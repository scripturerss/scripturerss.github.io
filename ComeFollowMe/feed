        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_33.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that they might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or how they should plant the seed, or the word of which he had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues.  But behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has said concerning prayer or worship?</li>
            <li id="alma_33.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my prayer.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee, thou didst hear me.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto thee, to be heard of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear them.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out and have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger with speedy destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now Alma said unto them: Do ye believe those scriptures which have been written by them of old?</li>
            <li id="alma_33.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos said; for, behold he said: Thou hast turned away thy judgments because of thy Son.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the scriptures?  If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?</li>
            <li id="alma_33.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of these things, but Zenock also spake of these things&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_33.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord, with this people, because they will not understand thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them because of thy Son.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, my brethren, ye see that a second prophet of old has testified of the Son of God, and because the people would not understand his words they stoned him to death.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who have spoken concerning the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live.  And many did look and live.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts.  But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished.  Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?</li>
            <li id="alma_33.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall plant this word in your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your faith.  And behold, it will become a tree, springing up in you unto everlasting life.  And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son.  And even all this can ye do if ye will.  Amen.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 32</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_32.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the people, entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their streets.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to have success among the poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_32.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the world.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them, and that they were in a preparation to hear the word.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched forth his hand, and cried unto those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent, and said unto them:</li>
            <li id="alma_32.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do?&#x2014;for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we cannot worship our God.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed&#x2014;yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now I ask, is this faith?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now of this thing ye must judge.  Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now as I said concerning faith&#x2014;faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also.  Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out&#x2014;now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_32.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now, as I said concerning faith&#x2014;that it was not a perfect knowledge&#x2014;even so it is with my words.  Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Now, we will compare the word unto a seed.  Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves&#x2014;It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now behold, would not this increase your faith?  I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow.  And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith?  Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed?  I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect?  Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> O then, is not this real?  I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us.  And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.</li>

            <li id="alma_35.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of these words, they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over into the land of Jershon.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the word unto the Zoramites, also came over into the land of Jershon.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the Zoramites had consulted together concerning the words which had been preached unto them, they were angry because of the word, for it did destroy their craft; therefore they would not hearken unto the words.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they sent and gathered together throughout all the land all the people, and consulted with them concerning the words which had been spoken.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now their rulers and their priests and their teachers did not let the people know concerning their desires; therefore they found out privily the minds of all the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all the people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were many; and they came over also into the land of Jershon.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did minister unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of Ammon who were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the Zoramites, being a very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon desiring them that they should cast out of their land all those who came over from them into their land.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he breathed out many threatenings against them.  And now the people of Ammon did not fear their words; therefore they did not cast them out, but they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites that came over unto them; and they did nourish them, and did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for their inheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their wants.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger against the people of Ammon, and they began to mix with the Lamanites and to stir them up also to anger against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against the people of Ammon, and also against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon, and came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon for the armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and the Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges; and an account shall be given of their wars hereafter.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the two sons of Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, after having been instruments in the hands of God of bringing many of the Zoramites to repentance; and as many as were brought to repentance were driven out of their land; but they have lands for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have taken up arms to defend themselves, and their wives, and children, and their lands.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now Alma, being grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea for the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which were among them; and having been to declare the word, or sent to declare the word, among all the people in every city; and seeing that the hearts of the people began to wax hard, and that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together, that he might give unto them every one his charge, separately, concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness. And we have an account of his commandments, which he gave unto them according to his own record.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_37.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the records which have been entrusted with me;</li>
            <li id="alma_37.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And I also command you that ye keep a record of this people, according as I have done, upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all these things sacred which I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it is for a wise purpose that they are kept.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_37.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their brightness; yea, and they will retain their brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates which do contain that which is holy writ.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer?</li>
            <li id="alma_37.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God.  And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land&#x2014;but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them) behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto you, for he has fulfilled his promises which he has made unto our fathers.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For he promised unto them that he would preserve these things for a wise purpose in him, that he might show forth his power unto future generations.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the restoration of many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also still show forth his power in them unto future generations; therefore they shall be preserved.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in fulfilling all my words, and that ye be diligent in keeping the commandments of God as they are written.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four plates, that ye keep them, that the mysteries and the works of darkness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those people who have been destroyed, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their plunderings, and all their wickedness and abominations, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these interpreters.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders and abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed from off the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the word of God might be fulfilled, which he spake, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_37.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret works and their abominations; and except they repent I will destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their secrets and abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they have been destroyed, and thus far the word of God has been fulfilled; yea, their secret abominations have been brought out of darkness and made known unto us.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all their signs and their wonders ye shall keep from this people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction shall come upon all those workers of darkness, according to the power of God, when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people might not be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and their covenants from this people, and only their wickedness and their murders and their abominations shall ye make known unto them; and ye shall teach them to abhor such wickedness and abominations and murders; and ye shall also teach them that these people were destroyed on account of their wickedness and abominations and their murders.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came among them to declare unto them concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their God for vengeance upon those who were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of darkness and secret combinations.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those workers of darkness and secret combinations, even unto destruction, except they repent before they are fully ripe.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto you; trust not those secret plans unto this people, but teach them an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, or director&#x2014;or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious a workmanship.  And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And it did work for them according to their faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was done; therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means it did show unto them marvelous works.  They were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey;</li>
            <li id="alma_37.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass (now these things were temporal) they did not prosper; even so it is with things which are spiritual.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And now I say, is there not a type in this thing?  For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us.  The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things, yea, see that ye look to God and live.  Go unto this people and declare the word, and be sober.  My son, farewell.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_40.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say unto thee; for I perceive that thy mind is worried concerning the resurrection of the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection&#x2014;or, I would say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on immortality, this corruption does not put on incorruption&#x2014;until after the coming of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead.  But behold, my son, the resurrection is not yet.  Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are kept, that no one knoweth them save God himself.  But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I might know&#x2014;that is concerning the resurrection.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth from the dead.  Now when this time cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time which is appointed.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case&#x2014;that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the time of the resurrection.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from this time of death to the time appointed for the resurrection?</li>
            <li id="alma_40.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise it mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this mattereth not; all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the resurrection.  And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I do know.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know that God knoweth all the times which are appointed unto man.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection&#x2014;Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil&#x2014;for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house&#x2014;and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection.  Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first resurrection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their consignation to happiness or misery.  Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the soul with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into heaven.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_40.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter cup.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_41.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this thing.  And I perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning this thing.  But behold, I will explain it unto thee.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order.  Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part of the body should be restored to itself.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil.  Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame&#x2014;mortality raised to immortality, corruption to incorruption&#x2014;raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_41.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And so it is on the other hand.  If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness.  Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?</li>
            <li id="alma_41.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish&#x2014;good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.</li>

            <li id="alma_38.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word&#x2019;s sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare unto me that I must stop the work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins.  But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ.  Behold, he is the life and the light of the world.  Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy&#x2014;yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down in peace.  Now go, my son, and teach the word unto this people.  Be sober.  My son, farewell.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_34.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_34.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that these things were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you what ye should do, because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_34.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are true.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true.  Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another.  Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother?  I say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</li>
            <li id="alma_34.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need&#x2014;I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God.  Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ;</li>
            <li id="alma_34.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptations of the devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile against those who do cast you out because of your exceeding poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them;</li>
            <li id="alma_34.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> But that ye have patience, and bear with those afflictions, with a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions.</li>

            <li id="alma_36.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.</li>

            <li id="alma_36.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words&#x2014;If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God&#x2014;I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</li>
            <li id="alma_36.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains.  Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors;</li>
            <li id="alma_36.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem; and he has also, by his everlasting power, delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from time to time even down to the present day; and I have always retained in remembrance their captivity; yea, and ye also ought to retain in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.  Now this is according to his word.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_43.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth among the people, to declare the word unto them.  And Alma, also, himself, could not rest, and he also went forth.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now we shall say no more concerning their preaching, except that they preached the word, and the truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and revelation; and they preached after the holy order of God by which they were called.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now I return to an account of the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their thousands; and they came into the land of Antionum, which is the land of the Zoramites; and a man by the name of Zerahemnah was their leader.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites were, in and of themselves, therefore, Zerahemnah appointed chief captains over the Lamanites, and they were all Amalekites and Zoramites.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now this he did that he might preserve their hatred towards the Nephites, that he might bring them into subjection to the accomplishment of his designs.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he did that he might usurp great power over them, and also that he might gain power over the Nephites by bringing them into bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and their houses, and their wives, and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might preserve their rights and their privileges, yea, and also their liberty, that they might worship God according to their desires.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites, that whosoever should worship God in spirit and in truth, the true and the living God, the Lamanites would destroy.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the people of Ammon&#x2014;and they would not take up arms, yea, they had entered into a covenant and they would not break it&#x2014;therefore, if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites they would be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be destroyed; therefore they gave them lands for their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large portion of their substance to support their armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled, alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, who were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all those who had dissented from the Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the descendants of the priests of Noah.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the Nephites; and thus the Nephites were obliged to contend with their brethren, even unto bloodshed.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass as the armies of the Lamanites had gathered together in the land of Antionum, behold, the armies of the Nephites were prepared to meet them in the land of Jershon.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who had been appointed to be the chief captain over the Nephites&#x2014;now the chief captain took the command of all the armies of the Nephites&#x2014;and his name was Moroni;</li>
            <li id="alma_43.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And Moroni took all the command, and the government of their wars.  And he was only twenty and five years old when he was appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that he met the Lamanites in the borders of Jershon, and his people were armed with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And when the armies of the Lamanites saw that the people of Nephi, or that Moroni, had prepared his people with breastplates and with arm-shields, yea, and also shields to defend their heads, and also they were dressed with thick clothing&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_43.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing; they had only their swords and their cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their stones and their slings; and they were naked, save it were a skin which was girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and the Amalekites;</li>
            <li id="alma_43.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But they were not armed with breastplates, nor shields&#x2014;therefore, they were exceedingly afraid of the armies of the Nephites because of their armor, notwithstanding their number being so much greater than the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come against the Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey round about in the wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of Manti and take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither they had gone.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go to defend themselves against the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma, and Alma informed the messengers of Moroni, that the armies of the Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness, that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might commence an attack upon the weaker part of the people.  And those messengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest by any means a part of the Lamanites should come into that land and take possession of the city, took the remaining part of his army and marched over into the land of Manti.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land should gather themselves together to battle against the Lamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights and their liberties; therefore they were prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should be secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on the west of the river Sidon in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And Moroni placed spies round about, that he might know when the camp of the Lamanites should come.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now, as Moroni knew the intention of the Lamanites, that it was their intention to destroy their brethren, or to subject them and bring them into bondage that they might establish a kingdom unto themselves over all the land;</li>
            <li id="alma_43.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And he also knowing that it was the only desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands, and their liberty, and their church, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem; therefore, he found by his spies which course the Lamanites were to take.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into the valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill Riplah;</li>
            <li id="alma_43.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the west of the river Sidon, and so down into the borders of the land Manti.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And thus having placed his army according to his desire, he was prepared to meet them.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up on the north of the hill, where a part of the army of Moroni was concealed.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into the valley, and began to cross the river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the south of the hill, which was led by a man whose name was Lehi, and he led his army forth and encircled the Lamanites about on the east in their rear.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites coming upon them in their rear, turned them about and began to contend with the army of Lehi.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was more dreadful on the part of the Lamanites, for their nakedness was exposed to the heavy blows of the Nephites with their swords and their cimeters, which brought death almost at every stroke.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords and the loss of blood, they being shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the body being shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their breastplates, and their armshields, and their head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of death among the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, because of the great destruction among them, even until they began to flee towards the river Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon, and they crossed the waters of Sidon.  And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon that they should not cross.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And it came to pass that Moroni and his army met the Lamanites in the valley, on the other side of the river Sidon, and began to fall upon them and to slay them.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And the Lamanites did flee again before them, towards the land of Manti; and they were met again by the armies of Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> Now in this case the Lamanites did fight exceedingly; yea, never had the Lamanites been known to fight with such exceedingly great strength and courage, no, not even from the beginning.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites, who were their chief captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their chief captain, or their chief leader and commander; yea, they did fight like dragons, and many of the Nephites were slain by their hands, yea, for they did smite in two many of their head-plates, and they did pierce many of their breastplates, and they did smite off many of their arms; and thus the Lamanites did smite in their fierce anger.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they owed to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers, that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed.  Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them.  And Moroni, perceiving their intent, sent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughts&#x2014;yea, the thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their freedom from bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And it came to pass that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they cried with one voice unto the Lord their God, for their liberty and their freedom from bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in that selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their freedom, the Lamanites began to flee before them; and they fled even to the waters of Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than double the number of the Nephites; nevertheless, they were driven insomuch that they were gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the bank by the river Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea, even on both sides of the river, for behold, on the east were the men of Lehi.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they were encircled about by the Nephites, they were struck with terror.</li>
            <li id="alma_43.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded his men that they should stop shedding their blood.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_42.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand&#x2014;which is concerning the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee.  For behold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken&#x2014;yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_42.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_42.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, it was appointed unto man to die&#x2014;therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth&#x2014;and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;</li>
            <li id="alma_42.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice.  Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the life of the soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now, how could a man repent except he should sin?  How could he sin if there was no law?  How could there be a law save there was a punishment?</li>
            <li id="alma_42.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of conscience unto man.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now, if there was no law given&#x2014;if a man murdered he should die&#x2014;would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?</li>
            <li id="alma_42.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could justice do, or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon the creature?</li>
            <li id="alma_42.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice?  I say unto you, Nay; not one whit.  If so, God would cease to be God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world.  And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more.  Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people.  And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them.  And may God grant unto you even according to my words.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_45.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son Helaman and said unto him: Believest thou the words which I spake unto thee concerning those records which have been kept?</li>
            <li id="alma_45.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And Helaman said unto him: Yea, I believe.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And Alma said again: Believest thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come?</li>
            <li id="alma_45.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And he said: Yea, I believe all the words which thou hast spoken.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And Alma said unto him again: Will ye keep my commandments?</li>
            <li id="alma_45.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he said: Yea, I will keep thy commandments with all my heart.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord shall prosper thee in this land.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, I have somewhat to prophesy unto thee; but what I prophesy unto thee ye shall not make known; yea, what I prophesy unto thee shall not be made known, even until the prophecy is fulfilled; therefore write the words which I shall say.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And these are the words: Behold, I perceive that this very people, the Nephites, according to the spirit of revelation which is in me, in four hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ shall manifest himself unto them, shall dwindle in unbelief.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, and then shall they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines and bloodshed, even until the people of Nephi shall become extinct&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_45.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall into the works of darkness, and lasciviousness, and all manner of iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the fourth generation shall not all pass away before this great iniquity shall come.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh that those who are now, or the seed of those who are now numbered among the people of Nephi, shall no more be numbered among the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great and dreadful day, shall be numbered among the Lamanites, and shall become like unto them, all, save it be a few who shall be called the disciples of the Lord; and them shall the Lamanites pursue even until they shall become extinct.  And now, because of iniquity, this prophecy shall be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass that after Alma had said these things to Helaman, he blessed him, and also his other sons; and he also blessed the earth for the righteous&#x2019; sake.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And he said: Thus saith the Lord God&#x2014;Cursed shall be the land, yea, this land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto destruction, which do wickedly, when they are fully ripe; and as I have said so shall it be; for this is the cursing and the blessing of God upon the land, for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, when Alma had said these words he blessed the church, yea, all those who should stand fast in the faith from that time henceforth.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And when Alma had done this he departed out of the land of Zarahemla, as if to go into the land of Melek.  And it came to pass that he was never heard of more; as to his death or burial we know not of.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses.  But behold, the scriptures saith the Lord took Moses unto himself; and we suppose that he has also received Alma in the spirit, unto himself; therefore, for this cause we know nothing concerning his death and burial.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now it came to pass in the commencement of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Helaman went forth among the people to declare the word unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the many little dissensions and disturbances which had been among the people, it became expedient that the word of God should be declared among them, yea, and that a regulation should be made throughout the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish the church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which was possessed by the people of Nephi.  And it came to pass that they did appoint priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches.</li>
            <li id="alma_45.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren had appointed priests and teachers over the churches that there arose a dissension among them, and they would not give heed to the words of Helaman and his brethren;</li>
            <li id="alma_45.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> But they grew proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because of their exceedingly great riches; therefore they grew rich in their own eyes, and would not give heed to their words, to walk uprightly before God.</li>

            <li id="alma_44.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from them.  And Moroni said unto Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do not desire to be men of blood.  Ye know that ye are in our hands, yet we do not desire to slay you.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of bondage.  But this is the very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our religion.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.  And now I would that ye should understand that this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in Christ.  And now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_44.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires which ye have for life, that ye deliver up your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will go your way and come not again to war against us.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in our hands, and I will command my men that they shall fall upon you, and inflict the wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we will see who shall have power over this people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these sayings he came forth and delivered up his sword and his cimeter, and his bow into the hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold, here are our weapons of war; we will deliver them up unto you, but we will not suffer ourselves to take an oath unto you, which we know that we shall break, and also our children; but take our weapons of war, and suffer that we may depart into the wilderness; otherwise we will retain our swords, and we will perish or conquer.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not believe that it is God that has delivered us into your hands; but we believe that it is your cunning that has preserved you from our swords.  Behold, it is your breastplates and your shields that have preserved you.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words, Moroni returned the sword and the weapons of war, which he had received, unto Zerahemnah, saying: Behold, we will end the conflict.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now I cannot recall the words which I have spoken, therefore as the Lord liveth, ye shall not depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not return again against us to war.  Now as ye are in our hands we will spill your blood upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I have proposed.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might slay Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of Moroni&#x2019;s soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and he also smote Zerahemnah that he took off his scalp and it fell to the earth.  And Zerahemnah withdrew from before them into the midst of his soldiers.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took up the scalp from off the ground by the hair, and laid it upon the point of his sword, and stretched it forth unto them, saying unto them with a loud voice:</li>
            <li id="alma_44.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the scalp of your chief, so shall ye fall to the earth except ye will deliver up your weapons of war and depart with a covenant of peace.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a covenant of peace.  And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to depart into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth, and he did stir up the remainder of his soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.  And it came to pass that they began to slay them; yea, and the Lamanites did contend with their swords and their might.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, their naked skins and their bare heads were exposed to the sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold they were pierced and smitten, yea, and did fall exceedingly fast before the swords of the Nephites; and they began to be swept down, even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni, promising that he would covenant and also his people with them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, that they never would come to war again against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death should cease again among the people.  And he took the weapons of war from the Lamanites; and after they had entered into a covenant with him of peace they were suffered to depart into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the greatness of the number; yea, the number of their dead was exceedingly great, both on the Nephites and on the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the waters of Sidon, and they have gone forth and are buried in the depths of the sea.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni, returned and came to their houses and their lands.</li>
            <li id="alma_44.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.  And thus ended the record of Alma, which was written upon the plates of Nephi.</li>

            <li id="alma_47.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had fled with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken those who went with him, and went up in the land of Nephi among the Lamanites, and did stir up the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land, among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives.  And it came to pass that they would not, or the more part of them would not, obey the commandments of the king.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now it came to pass that the king was wroth because of their disobedience; therefore he gave Amalickiah the command of that part of his army which was obedient unto his commands, and commanded him that he should go forth and compel them to arms.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very subtle man to do evil therefore he laid the plan in his heart to dethrone the king of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites who were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of those who were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was called Onidah, for thither had all the Lamanites fled; for they discovered the army coming, and, supposing that they were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah, to the place of arms.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them, being fixed in their minds with a determined resolution that they would not be subjected to go against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon the top of the mount which was called Antipas, in preparation to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now it was not Amalickiah&#x2019;s intention to give them battle according to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret embassy into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those who were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should come down to the foot of the mount, for he desired to speak with him.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he durst not go down to the foot of the mount.  And it came to pass that Amalickiah sent again the second time, desiring him to come down.  And it came to pass that Lehonti would not; and he sent again the third time.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could not get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to Lehonti&#x2019;s camp; and he sent again the fourth time his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti&#x2019;s hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Lehonti came down with his men and surrounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded, they pled with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to fall in with their brethren, that they might not be destroyed.  Now this was the very thing which Amalickiah desired.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to the commands of the king.  Now this was the thing that Amalickiah desired, that he might accomplish his designs in dethroning the king.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief leader was killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief leader.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Amalickiah caused that one of his servants should administer poison by degrees to Lehonti, that he died.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now, when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites appointed Amalickiah to be their leader and their chief commander.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that Amalickiah marched with his armies (for he had gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, which was the chief city.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And the king came out to meet him with his guards, for he supposed that Amalickiah had fulfilled his commands, and that Amalickiah had gathered together so great an army to go against the Nephites to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> But behold, as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah caused that his servants should go forth to meet the king.  And they went and bowed themselves before the king, as if to reverence him because of his greatness.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that the king put forth his hand to raise them, as was the custom with the Lamanites, as a token of peace, which custom they had taken from the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that when he had raised the first from the ground, behold he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell to the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now the servants of the king fled; and the servants of Amalickiah raised a cry, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_47.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold, the servants of the king have stabbed him to the heart, and he has fallen and they have fled; behold, come and see.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that Amalickiah commanded that his armies should march forth and see what had happened to the king; and when they had come to the spot, and found the king lying in his gore, Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, and said: Whosoever loved the king, let him go forth, and pursue his servants that they may be slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that all they who loved the king, when they heard these words, came forth and pursued after the servants of the king.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now when the servants of the king saw an army pursuing after them, they were frightened again, and fled into the wilderness, and came over into the land of Zarahemla and joined the people of Ammon.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And the army which pursued after them returned, having pursued after them in vain; and thus Amalickiah, by his fraud, gained the hearts of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass on the morrow he entered the city Nephi with his armies, and took possession of the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had heard that the king was slain&#x2014;for Amalickiah had sent an embassy to the queen informing her that the king had been slain by his servants, that he had pursued them with his army, but it was in vain, and they had made their escape&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_47.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Therefore, when the queen had received this message she sent unto Amalickiah, desiring him that he would spare the people of the city; and she also desired him that he should come in unto her; and she also desired him that he should bring witnesses with him to testify concerning the death of the king.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew the king, and all them who were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they all testified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants; and they said also: They have fled; does not this testify against them?   And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the death of the king.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the queen, and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud, and by the assistance of his cunning servants, he obtained the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the people of the Lamanites, who were composed of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the present time.</li>
            <li id="alma_47.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Now these dissenters, having the same instruction and the same information of the Nephites, yea, having been instructed in the same knowledge of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to relate, not long after their dissensions they became more hardened and impenitent, and more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites&#x2014;drinking in with the traditions of the Lamanites; giving way to indolence, and all manner of lasciviousness; yea, entirely forgetting the Lord their God.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_46.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the words of Helaman and his brethren were gathered together against their brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now behold, they were exceedingly wroth, insomuch that they were determined to slay them.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who were wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and they were the greater part of them the lower judges of the land, and they were seeking for power.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, notwithstanding the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church, for they were high priests over the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the hand of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place among the children of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous&#x2019; sake.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it&#x2014;In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children&#x2014;and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_46.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those who were true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should come.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God, he named all the land which was south of the land Desolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and on the south&#x2014;A chosen land, and the land of liberty.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are despised because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be trodden down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own transgressions.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with a loud voice, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_46.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their loins, rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed.  And he said&#x2014;Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto God.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now behold, this was the language of Jacob.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us?  Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he went forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions, and gathered together all the people who were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called Amalickiahites.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites&#x2014;and he also saw that his people were doubtful concerning the justice of the cause in which they had undertaken&#x2014;therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, he took those of his people who would and departed into the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more strength; therefore he thought to cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his armies, who had gathered themselves together, and armed themselves, and entered into a covenant to keep the peace&#x2014;and it came to pass that he took his army and marched out with his tents into the wilderness, to cut off the course of Amalickiah in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and marched forth into the wilderness, and headed the armies of Amalickiah.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that Amalickiah fled with a small number of his men, and the remainder were delivered up into the hands of Moroni and were taken back into the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Now, Moroni being a man who was appointed by the chief judges and the voice of the people, therefore he had power according to his will with the armies of the Nephites, to establish and to exercise authority over them.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death; and there were but few who denied the covenant of freedom.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty to be hoisted upon every tower which was in all the land, which was possessed by the Nephites; and thus Moroni planted the standard of liberty among the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did maintain peace in the land until nearly the end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in the church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have much peace and rejoicing in the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly believing that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they went out of the world rejoicing.</li>
            <li id="alma_46.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons of the year were very frequent in the land&#x2014;but not so much so with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots which God had prepared to remove the cause of diseases, to which men were subject by the nature of the climate&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_46.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> But there were many who died with old age; and those who died in the faith of Christ are happy in him, as we must needs suppose.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_49.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the nineteenth year, on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the Lamanites were seen approaching towards the land of Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an army by the borders of the city, and they had cast up dirt round about to shield them from the arrows and the stones of the Lamanites; for behold, they fought with stones and with arrows.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the Nephites had dug up a ridge of earth round about them, which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them that they might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of entrance.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were astonished exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their places of security.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the greatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also prepared themselves with shields, and with breastplates; and they had also prepared themselves with garments of skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily overpower and subject their brethren to the yoke of bondage, or slay and massacre them according to their pleasure.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared for them, in a manner which never had been known among the children of Lehi.  Now they were prepared for the Lamanites, to battle after the manner of the instructions of Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, were exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for war.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi, at the head of his army, perhaps he would have caused the Lamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah; for behold, he did care not for the blood of his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle.  And behold, his chief captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs among the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were disappointed in their places of retreat and they could not come upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp and marched towards the land of Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for them to come against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built forts of security, for every city in all the land round about; therefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, their chief captains came forward and took an oath that they would destroy the people of that city.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which had hitherto been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, become strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed that they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they would march thither to battle; and thus it was according to his desires.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the Lamanites in the valley on the east of the river Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless their chief captains had sworn with an oath to attack the city; therefore, they brought up their armies.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of security by any other way save by the entrance, because of the highness of the bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch which had been dug round about, save it were by the entrance.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any other way, by casting over stones and arrows at them.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with their swords and their slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come into their place of security by the place of entrance; and thus were they prepared to defend themselves against the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with an immense slaughter.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth that they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown at them; and instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in a measure with their dead and wounded bodies.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness.  And it came to pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth, concerning their great loss.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his people, because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did curse God, and also Moroni, swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood; and this because Moroni had kept the commandments of God in preparing for the safety of his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did thank the Lord their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly great prosperity in the church because of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach among the people.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_48.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that, as soon as Amalickiah had obtained the kingdom he began to inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to speak unto the Lamanites from their towers, against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites, insomuch that in the latter end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far, yea, having been made king over the Lamanites, he sought also to reign over all the land, yea, and all the people who were in the land, the Nephites as well as the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened the hearts of the Lamanites and blinded their minds, and stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he had gathered together a numerous host to go to battle against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of his people, to overpower the Nephites and to bring them into bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And thus he did appoint chief captains of the Zoramites, they being the most acquainted with the strength of the Nephites, and their places of resort, and the weakest parts of their cities; therefore he appointed them to be chief captains over his armies.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that they took their camp, and moved forth toward the land of Zarahemla in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now it came to pass that while Amalickiah had thus been obtaining power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on the other hand, had been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting small forts, or places of resort; throwing up banks of earth round about to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to encircle them about, round about their cities and the borders of their lands; yea, all round about the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And in their weakest fortifications he did place the greater number of men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus he was preparing to support their liberty, their lands, their wives, and their children, and their peace, and that they might live unto the Lord their God, and that they might maintain that which was called by their enemies the cause of Christians.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery;</li>
            <li id="alma_48.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were also taught never to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the sword except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And this was their faith, that by so doing God would prosper them in the land, or in other words, if they were faithful in keeping the commandments of God that he would prosper them in the land; yea, warn them to flee, or to prepare for war, according to their danger;</li>
            <li id="alma_48.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And also, that God would make it known unto them whither they should go to defend themselves against their enemies, and by so doing, the Lord would deliver them; and this was the faith of Moroni, and his heart did glory in it; not in the shedding of blood but in doing good, in preserving his people, yea, in keeping the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God, and they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would hearken unto their words.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And thus they went forth, and the people did humble themselves because of their words, insomuch that they were highly favored of the Lord, and thus they were free from wars and contentions among themselves, yea, even for the space of four years.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth year, yea, notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves, they were compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren, the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space of many years with the Lamanites, notwithstanding their much reluctance.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now, they were sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites, because they did not delight in the shedding of blood; yea, and this was not all&#x2014;they were sorry to be the means of sending so many of their brethren out of this world into an eternal world, unprepared to meet their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their wives and their children should be massacred by the barbarous cruelty of those who were once their brethren, yea, and had dissented from their church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_48.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over the blood of the Nephites, so long as there were any who should keep the commandments of God, for the promise of the Lord was, if they should keep his commandments they should prosper in the land.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_50.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making preparations for war, or to defend his people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges, that they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round about all the cities, throughout all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there should be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about the cities.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a frame of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they were strong and high.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and slay him who should attempt to approach near the walls of the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their enemies, round about every city in all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites who were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea to the west.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants who were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders by the seashore, and possess the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their possessions, and caused them to erect fortifications that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the river Sidon&#x2014;the Nephites possessing all the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possession.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one in a particular manner which they called Lehi, which was in the north by the borders of the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus ended the twentieth year.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi in the commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_50.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land.  But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their destructions.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign of the judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a contention which took place among them concerning the land of Lehi, and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the borders of Lehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did claim a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began to be a warm contention between them, insomuch that the people of Morianton took up arms against their brethren, and they were determined by the sword to slay them.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to the camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for assistance; for behold they were not in the wrong.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who were led by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceedingly fearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which was northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which would have been a cause to have been lamented) but behold, Morianton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her much.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of Moroni, and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and also concerning their intentions to flee into the land northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of Morianton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi, yea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people of Morianton, to stop their flight into the land northward.</li>

            <li id="alma_50.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so stubborn were the people of Morianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering words) that a battle commenced between them, in the which Teancum did slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of Moroni.  And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus were the people of Morianton brought back.  And upon their covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that in the same year that the people of Nephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second chief judge, died, having filled the judgment-seat with perfect uprightness before God.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those records and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son, Helaman.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed chief judge and governor over the people, with an oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> Now behold, his name was Pahoran.  And Pahoran did fill the seat of his father, and did commence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year, over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_39.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my son, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I said unto thy brother; for behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments of God?  Behold, has he not set a good example for thee?</li>
            <li id="alma_39.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the Zoramites.  Now this is what I have against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And this is not all, my son.  Thou didst do that which was grievous unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron among the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot Isabel.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son.  Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?</li>
            <li id="alma_39.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is unpardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so great a crime.  I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for your good.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.  Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots.  Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy children to do good, lest they lead away the hearts of many people to destruction; therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of God, that ye refrain from your iniquities;</li>
            <li id="alma_39.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the coming of Christ.  Behold, I say unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings unto this people, to prepare their minds; or rather that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the minds of their children to hear the word at the time of his coming.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. Behold, you marvel why these things should be known so long beforehand.  Behold, I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as a soul will be at the time of his coming?</li>
            <li id="alma_39.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be made known unto this people as well as unto their children?</li>
            <li id="alma_39.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel to declare these glad tidings unto us as unto our children, or as after the time of his coming?</li>

He felt something similar after returning from his mission to the Zoramites&#x2014;he observed that the hearts of many of the Nephites &#x201C;began to wax hard, and that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word,&#x201D; and this made his heart &#x201C;exceedingly sorrowful&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/35?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15">Alma 35:15</a>). What did Alma do about what he saw and felt? He didn&#x2019;t simply become discouraged or cynical about the state of the world. Instead, &#x201C;he caused that his sons should be gathered together&#x201D; and taught them &#x201C;things pertaining unto righteousness&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/35?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16">Alma 35:16</a>).

<p data-aid="154411258" id="p2">Few of us will have experiences as dramatic as Alma&#x2019;s conversion. But everyone must be &#x201C;born of God,&#x201D; though it usually happens gradually (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&amp;id=p23#p23">Alma 36:23</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">38:6</a>). As you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng">Alma&#xA0;36</a>, think about what it means to be born of God. For instance, in the process of being born of God, how do you feel about sin? about Jesus Christ? How does being born of God affect what you do in response to your own mistakes? What other changes occur in your beliefs and actions? Ponder how you are experiencing these changes.</p>

<p data-aid="154411271" id="p4">Sometimes people are afraid to repent because they see repentance as a painful punishment for sin. What do you think Alma would say about that? To find out, you could contrast what Alma&#x2019;s life was like before he repented (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p17#p6">Alma 36:6&#x2013;17</a>) with his description of himself after he repented (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&amp;id=p18-p27#p18">verses 18&#x2013;27</a>).

<p data-aid="154411347" id="p17">Your children might enjoy finding small items that make big things happen. Items like a battery, car key, or even a toy that comforts them might be examples. You could then read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p7#p6">Alma 37:6&#x2013;7</a> together and think of some small or simple things that God wants us to do.

<p data-aid="154410243" id="p1">For the Zoramites, prayer consisted of standing where all could see and repeating empty, self-satisfied words. The Zoramites lacked faith in Jesus Christ&#x2014;even denied His existence&#x2014;and persecuted the poor (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p9-p25#p9">Alma 31:9&#x2013;25</a>). By contrast, Alma and Amulek taught that prayer has more to do with what happens in our hearts than on a public platform. And if we do not show compassion toward people in need, our prayer is &#x201C;vain, and availeth &#x2026; nothing&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p28#p28">Alma 34:28</a>). Most important, we pray because we have faith in Jesus Christ, who offers redemption through His &#x201C;infinite and eternal sacrifice&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10">Alma 34:10</a>). Such faith, Alma explained, starts with humility and a &#x201C;desire to believe&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&amp;id=p27#p27">Alma 32:27</a>). Over time, with constant nourishment, the word of God takes root in our hearts until it becomes &#x201C;a tree springing up unto everlasting life&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&amp;id=p41#p41">Alma 32:41</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154410257" id="p7">Alma and Amulek&#x2019;s counsel about worship and prayer was meant to correct specific misunderstandings the Zoramites had.

</header>
<p data-aid="154410264" id="p9">Notice how many times Amulek used the words <i>infinite</i> and <i>eternal</i> to describe the Savior&#x2019;s atoning sacrifice in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p9-p14#p9">Alma 34:9&#x2013;14</a>. Why is it important to know that the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement is infinite and eternal? Look for words and phrases in these verses that also describe the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement: <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/heb/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10">Hebrews 10:10</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&amp;id=p21#p21">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:21</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">Mosiah 3:13</a>.</p>
<p data-aid="154410266" id="p10">Even when we know Jesus&#x2019;s power to save is infinite and eternal, we might sometimes doubt that it applies to us&#x2014;or to someone who has sinned against us. Elder David&#xA0;A. Bednar once spoke of people who &#x201C;seem to have faith in the Savior, but they do not believe His promised blessings are available to them&#x201D; (&#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2016/10/if-ye-had-known-me?lang=eng">If Ye Had Known Me</a>,&#x201D; <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2016,&#xA0;104). What might keep us from fully receiving the Savior&#x2019;s power? Ponder how you can know that the Atonement of Jesus Christ is infinite and eternal.</p>
<p data-aid="154410267" id="p11">To ponder how much you need the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement, it might help to think of something you need every day. Ask yourself, &#x201C;What would my life be like without this?&#x201D; Then, as you study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p9-p16#p9">Alma 34:9&#x2013;16</a>, ponder what your life would be like without Jesus Christ. You could find other insights in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&amp;id=p7-p9#p7">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:7&#x2013;9</a>.

<div class="body-block">
<p data-aid="154411198" id="p1">The accounts in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng">Alma 30&#x2013;31</a> clearly demonstrate the power of words&#x2014;for evil and for good. The &#x201C;flattering&#x201D; and &#x201C;great swelling words&#x201D; of a false teacher named Korihor threatened to bring &#x201C;many souls down to destruction&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p31,47#p31">Alma 30:31,&#xA0;47</a>). Similarly, the teachings of a Nephite dissenter named Zoram led a whole group of people to fall &#x201C;into great errors&#x201D; and &#x201C;pervert the ways of the Lord&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p9,11#p9">Alma 31:9,&#xA0;11</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154411200" id="p2">In contrast, Alma had unwavering faith that the word of God would have a &#x201C;more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Alma 31:5</a>). Alma&#x2019;s words expressed eternal truth and drew upon the powers of Jesus Christ to silence Korihor (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p39-p50#p39">Alma 30:39&#x2013;50</a>), and they invited His blessing on those who went with him to bring the Zoramites back to the truth (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p31-p38#p31">Alma 31:31&#x2013;38</a>). These are valuable examples for followers of Christ today when false messages are common. We can find truth by trusting, as Alma did, &#x201C;the virtue of the word of God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Alma 31:5</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154411207" id="p3">In <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng">Alma&#xA0;30</a>, Korihor is called &#x201C;Anti-Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">verse&#xA0;6</a>). An anti-Christ is anyone or anything that is openly or secretly in opposition to Jesus Christ and His gospel. Which verses in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p31#p6">Alma 30:6&#x2013;31</a> show that Korihor fits this description? Studying Korihor&#x2019;s false teachings can help you recognize and reject similar teachings. The following activities may help in your study:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154411209" id="p4">What object lessons can you think of to better understand the difference between the Savior&#x2019;s teachings and Satan&#x2019;s false imitations?

Explain that this is not how we should pray. As you and your children talk about how we should pray, let them remove the blocks or rocks one at a time. Maybe they could keep one of the rocks by their bed as a reminder to pray every morning and night. They might enjoy decorating their rock.</p>

<p data-aid="154410270" id="p1">When someone we love has made a serious mistake, it can be hard to know how to respond. Part of what makes <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng">Alma 39&#x2013;42</a> so valuable is that it reveals how Alma&#x2014;a disciple of Christ who once had his own grievous sins to repent of&#x2014;handled such a situation. Alma&#x2019;s son Corianton had committed sexual sin, and Alma, as he had learned to do in his ministry, trusted the power of true doctrine to give his son an eternal perspective and encourage repentance (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p19#p19">Alma 4:19</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">31:5</a>). In these chapters, we observe Alma&#x2019;s boldness in condemning sin and his tenderness and love for Corianton. And ultimately, we sense Alma&#x2019;s confidence that the Savior &#x201C;shall come to take away the sins of the world [and] declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15">Alma 39:15</a>). The fact that Corianton repented and eventually returned to the work of the ministry (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/49?lang=eng&amp;id=p30#p30">Alma 49:30</a>) can give us hope for forgiveness and redemption when we are troubled about our own sins or the sins of someone we love (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&amp;id=p29#p29">Alma 42:29</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154410280" id="p4">Alma&#x2019;s counsel to his son Corianton in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng">Alma&#xA0;39</a> provides a great opportunity to learn about the devastating effects of sexual sin, including pornography. Perhaps more important, it can also help you understand the Savior&#x2019;s offer of forgiveness and healing to people who repent. These questions and activities may help:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154410282" id="p5">What mistakes led Corianton to break the law of chastity?

(see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p13#p5">verses 5&#x2013;13</a>). What evidence do we have that Corianton repented?

<p data-aid="154410307" id="p10">Corianton had some questions about what happens after death.

As you study, make a list of the truths you find about things like the spirit world, resurrection, and judgment.

<p data-aid="154410361" id="p14">Alma&#x2019;s counsel to Corianton can help your children understand the importance of being a good example. Consider reading together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&amp;id=p1#p1">Alma 39:1</a>. How was Corianton&#x2019;s brother Shiblon a good example?

<p data-aid="154410367" id="p15">You could also play a game in which you and your children take turns following or imitating each other.

<p data-aid="154410373" id="p16">With a flashlight or a picture of the sun, you could compare light to the power of a good example. You and your children could also look at pictures of Jesus doing good things and talk about the example He set for us. The videos &#x201C;Shine Your Light So Others May See&#x201D; and &#x201C;Lessons I Learned as a Boy&#x201D; can help your children discuss how their example can lead people to Christ.</p>
