        <div class="chapterheading">Third Nephi<br/>The Book of Nephi<br/><b class="small">The Son of Nephi, Who Was the Son of Helaman</b></div>
        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed away and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief judge and the governor over the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest son, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which had been kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man knoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead, yea, the record of this people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and greater miracles wrought among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath been vain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken might not come to pass.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord all that day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son&#x2014;of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh.  And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day.  And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the words of the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass also that a new star did appear, according to the word.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins.  And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses.  Now in this thing they did err, having not understood the scriptures.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were convinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known unto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass away till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year were they brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess their faults.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come to pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they began to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth year;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of Mosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was given, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come into the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of the records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be found in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had passed away the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction because of this war, which had become exceedingly sore.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites.  And thus ended the thirteenth year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret places.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And thus ended the fourteenth year.  And in the fifteenth year they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many contentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many advantages over them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people in a state of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of their iniquity.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their secret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both which were in the land south and which were in the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found that it was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was no way that they could subsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land insomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from before them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain.  And thus was the end of Giddianhi the robber.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did return again to their place of security.  And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in the twentieth year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store,</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the wilderness insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with hunger.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by night, and falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by tens of thousands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, because of the great destruction which came upon them by night and by day.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and march into the furthermost parts of the land northward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of their weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their retreat.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front and in their rear.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in their places of retreat.  And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up prisoners unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were slain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead.  And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing, and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_16.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city.  And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working miracles among the people, that they might know that the Christ must shortly come&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and remember at the time of their coming that they had been made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing their sins.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus ended also the eighty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges, there were great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the scriptures began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon their own strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot come to pass, of which has been spoken.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to reason and to contend among themselves, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself unto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, why will he not show himself in this land as well as in the land of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield ourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And many more things did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman and his sons.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all return to their own lands in the twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and his cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their provisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and they did return to their own lands and their possessions, both on the north and on the south, both on the land northward and on the land southward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and those who had been appointed leaders, who had established this great peace in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and there were many old cities repaired.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had continual peace.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began to be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride and boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers, and many officers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this&#x2014;Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do all manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a few years.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year&#x2014;the people having been delivered up for the space of a long time to be carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should&#x2014;and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel against God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did govern the people that year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent forth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry because of those who testified of these things; and those who were angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been high priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers were angry with those who testified of these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could have power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation was signed by the governor of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now there were many of those who testified of the things pertaining to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put to death secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their death came not unto the governor of the land until after their death.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that any man should be put to death except they had power from the governor of the land&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned the prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up before the judge, to be judged of the crime which they had done, according to the law which had been given by the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and the high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with the kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine against all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord, and enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those who were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be administered according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their country; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the governor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land should no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the land did hear these sayings, and did witness of it.  And after these sayings there was silence in the land for the space of many hours;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For so great was the astonishment of the people that they did cease lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain; therefore there was silence in all the land for the space of many hours.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings shall become desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the covenant to your fathers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words, behold, they began to weep and howl again because of the loss of their kindred and friends.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away.  And it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled which had been spoken by the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared&#x2014;</li>

            <li id="3 ne_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word&#x2014;Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you with utter destruction.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us&#x2014;not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will command that my armies shall come down against you, and they shall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall become extinct.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been handed down unto us.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and government, who have dissented away from you because of your wickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs.  I am Giddianhi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in nowise be delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains over all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great commander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land Desolation.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land.  Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land northward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies.  And Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of every kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the people of king Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire because of their sins and their wickedness, which was above all the wickedness of the whole earth, because of their secret murders and combinations; for it was they that did destroy the peace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I did cause them to be burned, to destroy them from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up unto me any more against them.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of all the holy prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that they must be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come, because of the many signs which had been given, according to the words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and night.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would murder no more were set at liberty.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have those secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against their brethren were condemned and punished according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret, and abominable combinations, in the which there was so much wickedness, and so many murders committed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the twenty and third year also, and the twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and thus had twenty and five years passed away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there had many things transpired which, in the eyes of some, would be great and marvelous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this book; yea, this book cannot contain even a hundredth part of what was done among so many people in the space of twenty and five years;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold there are records which do contain all the proceedings of this people; and a shorter but true account was given by Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore I have made my record of these things according to the record of Nephi, which was engraven on the plates which were called the plates of Nephi.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, a small record of that which hath taken place from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And then I do make a record of the things which I have seen with mine own eyes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And I know the record which I make to be a just and a true record; nevertheless there are many things which, according to our language, we are not able to write.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi.  I have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it were himself and those whom he brought out of that land) and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the salvation of our souls.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been merciful unto the seed of Joseph.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept his commandments he hath blessed them and prospered them according to his word.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of Joseph to the knowledge of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And as surely as the Lord liveth, will he gather in from the four quarters of the earth all the remnant of the seed of Jacob, who are scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And as he hath covenanted with all the house of Jacob, even so shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house of Jacob be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the restoring all the house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant that he hath covenanted with them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And then shall they know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four quarters of the earth unto their own lands, from whence they have been dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shall it be.

            <li id="3 ne_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the people were divided one against another; and they did separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and thus they became tribes and leaders of tribes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much family and many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes became exceedingly great.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they did yield themselves unto the power of Satan.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the regulations of the government were destroyed, because of the secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those who murdered the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch that the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become wicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had given his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes of the people, who were united together save it were their leaders did establish their laws, every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred of those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the government.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people.  And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they were divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders.  But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that Nephi&#x2014;having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds&#x2014;went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book.  And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Thus passed away the thirty and second year also.  And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with water.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a remission of their sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did keep the record&#x2014;for he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed away;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the time that there should be darkness for the space of three days over the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among the people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it was about to divide asunder.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had been known in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were drowned.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in the place of the city there became a great mountain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And there was a great and terrible destruction in the land southward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the land northward; for behold, the whole face of the land was changed, because of the tempest and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings and the lightnings, and the exceedingly great quaking of the whole earth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled, and many smooth places became rough.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And many great and notable cities were sunk, and many were burned, and many were shaken till the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain, and the places were left desolate.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And there were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was exceedingly great, and there were many in them who were slain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there were some who were carried away in the whirlwind; and whither they went no man knoweth, save they know that they were carried away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found in broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease&#x2014;for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours&#x2014;and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen could feel the vapor of darkness;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any light at all;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great city Moronihah.  And thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with another, and were showing one to another the great and marvelous change which had taken place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name&#x2014;hear ye him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Hosanna!  Blessed be the name of the Most High God!  And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord and did kiss his feet.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the Lord commanded him that he should arise.  And he arose and stood before him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize.  And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them&#x2014;Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize.  And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the hypocrites, for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.  Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.  If, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.  Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</li>

For behold, ye are they whom I have chosen to minister unto this people.  Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.  Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.  Are ye not much better than they?</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And why take ye thought for raiment?  Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, even so will he clothe you, if ye are not of little faith.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?  or, What shall we drink?  or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_12.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the light of this people.  A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_12.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost senine.  And while ye are in prison can ye pay even one senine?  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your heart;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For it is better that ye should deny yourselves of these things, wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye should be cast into hell.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> It hath been written, that whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whoso shall marry her who is divorced committeth adultery.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And again it is written, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> But verily, verily, I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God&#x2019;s throne;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair black or white;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever cometh of more than these is evil.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And behold, it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> But I say unto you, that ye shall not resist evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn thou not away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> But behold I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> Therefore those things which were of old time, which were under the law, in me are all fulfilled.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and said unto them: Behold, ye have heard the things which I taught before I ascended to my Father; therefore, whoso remembereth these sayings of mine and doeth them, him will I raise up at the last day.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words he perceived that there were some among them who marveled, and wondered what he would concerning the law of Moses; for they understood not the saying that old things had passed away, and that all things had become new.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he said unto them: Marvel not that I said unto you that old things had passed away, and that all things had become new.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, I say unto you that the law is fulfilled that was given unto Moses.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted with my people Israel; therefore, the law in me is fulfilled, for I have come to fulfil the law; therefore it hath an end.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, I do not destroy the prophets, for as many as have not been fulfilled in me, verily I say unto you, shall all be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And because I said unto you that old things have passed away, I do not destroy that which hath been spoken concerning things which are to come.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For behold, the covenant which I have made with my people is not all fulfilled; but the law which was given unto Moses hath an end in me.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Behold, I am the law, and the light.  Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live; for unto him that endureth to the end will I give eternal life.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I have given unto you the commandments; therefore keep my commandments.  And this is the law and the prophets, for they truly testified of me.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he said unto those twelve whom he had chosen:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto this people, who are a remnant of the house of Joseph.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And behold, this is the land of your inheritance; and the Father hath given it unto you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And not at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should tell it unto your brethren at Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Neither at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should tell unto them concerning the other tribes of the house of Israel, whom the Father hath led away out of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> This much did the Father command me, that I should tell unto them:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> That other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now, because of stiffneckedness and unbelief they understood not my word; therefore I was commanded to say no more of the Father concerning this thing unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> But, verily, I say unto you that the Father hath commanded me, and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them because of their iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity that they know not of you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And verily, I say unto you again that the other tribes hath the Father separated from them; and it is because of their iniquity that they know not of them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And they understood me not, for they supposed it had been the Gentiles; for they understood not that the Gentiles should be converted through their preaching.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my voice&#x2014;that I should not manifest myself unto them save it were by the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> But behold, ye have both heard my voice, and seen me; and ye are my sheep, and ye are numbered among those whom the Father hath given me.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For they of whom I speak are they who have not as yet heard my voice; neither have I at any time manifested myself unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But I have received a commandment of the Father that I shall go unto them, and that they shall hear my voice, and shall be numbered among my sheep, that there may be one fold and one shepherd; therefore I go to show myself unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I command you that ye shall write these sayings after I am gone, that if it so be that my people at Jerusalem, they who have seen me and been with me in my ministry, do not ask the Father in my name, that they may receive a knowledge of you by the Holy Ghost, and also of the other tribes whom they know not of, that these sayings which ye shall write shall be kept and shall be manifested unto the Gentiles, that through the fulness of the Gentiles, the remnant of their seed, who shall be scattered forth upon the face of the earth because of their unbelief, may be brought in, or may be brought to a knowledge of me, their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And then will I gather them in from the four quarters of the earth; and then will I fulfil the covenant which the Father hath made unto all the people of the house of Israel.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles&#x2014;for notwithstanding they have come forth upon the face of this land, and have scattered my people who are of the house of Israel; and my people who are of the house of Israel have been cast out from among them, and have been trodden under feet by them;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And because of the mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles, and also the judgments of the Father upon my people who are of the house of Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, that after all this, and I have caused my people who are of the house of Israel to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to be slain, and to be cast out from among them, and to become hated by them, and to become a hiss and a byword among them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus commandeth the Father that I should say unto you: At that day when the Gentiles shall sin against my gospel, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride of their hearts above all nations, and above all the people of the whole earth, and shall be filled with all manner of lyings, and of deceits, and of mischiefs, and all manner of hypocrisy, and murders, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of secret abominations; and if they shall do all those things, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, behold, saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of my gospel from among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And then will I remember my covenant which I have made unto my people, O house of Israel, and I will bring my gospel unto them.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_16.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, thus hath the Father commanded me&#x2014;that I should give unto this people this land for their inheritance.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_17.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he looked round about again on the multitude, and he said unto them: Behold, my time is at hand.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But now I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Have ye any that are sick among you?  Bring them hither.  Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner?  Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon the ground.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith.  And now behold, my joy is full.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And when he had done this he wept again;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_17.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they know that their record is true for they all of them did see and hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women, and children.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_18.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that Jesus commanded his Disciples that they should bring forth some bread and wine unto him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And while they were gone for bread and wine, he commanded the multitude that they should sit themselves down upon the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And when the Disciples had come with bread and wine, he took of the bread and brake and blessed it; and he gave unto the Disciples and commanded that they should eat.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And when they had eaten and were filled, he commanded that they should give unto the multitude.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto the Disciples: Behold there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power that he shall break bread and bless it and give it unto the people of my church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shown unto you.  And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me.  And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that when he said these words, he commanded his Disciples that they should take of the wine of the cup and drink of it, and that they should also give unto the multitude that they might drink of it.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they did so, and did drink of it and were filled; and they gave unto the multitude, and they did drink, and they were filled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when the Disciples had done this, Jesus said unto them: Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is fulfilling my commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye are willing to do that which I have commanded you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And this shall ye always do to those who repent and are baptized in my name; and ye shall do it in remembrance of my blood, which I have shed for you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me.  And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things.  And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my rock.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell are ready open to receive them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments, which the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church, among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name.  Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto his Disciples, he turned again unto the multitude and said unto them:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and if it so be that they come unto you oft ye shall pray for them unto the Father, in my name.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world.  Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up&#x2014;that which ye have seen me do.  Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he turned his eyes again upon the Disciples whom he had chosen, and said unto them:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you another commandment, and then I must go unto my Father that I may fulfil other commandments which he hath given me.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people, for behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that ye come not under condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father condemneth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And I give you these commandments because of the disputations which have been among you.  And blessed are ye if ye have no disputations among you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And now I go unto the Father, because it is expedient that I should go unto the Father for your sakes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, he touched with his hand the Disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And the multitude heard not the words which he spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the Disciples bare record that he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost.  And I will show unto you hereafter that this record is true.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all, there came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could not see Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_18.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And while they were overshadowed he departed from them, and ascended into heaven.  And the Disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again into heaven.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_19.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven, the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his children and did return to his own home.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before it was yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered unto them, and that he would also show himself on the morrow unto the multitude.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that there were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor exceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was gathered together, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had raised from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah&#x2014;now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had chosen&#x2014;and it came to pass that they went forth and stood in the midst of the multitude.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And behold, the multitude was so great that they did cause that they should be separated into twelve bodies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the twelve did teach the multitude; and behold, they did cause that the multitude should kneel down upon the face of the earth, and should pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the disciples did pray unto the Father also in the name of Jesus.  And it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And when they had ministered those same words which Jesus had spoken&#x2014;nothing varying from the words which Jesus had spoken&#x2014;behold, they knelt again and prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when they had thus prayed they went down unto the water&#x2019;s edge, and the multitude followed them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went down into the water and was baptized.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And he came up out of the water and began to baptize.  And he baptized all those whom Jesus had chosen.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass when they were all baptized and had come up out of the water, the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, they were encircled about as if it were by fire; and it came down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it, and did bear record; and angels did come down out of heaven and did minister unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that while the angels were ministering unto the disciples, behold, Jesus came and stood in the midst and ministered unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and commanded them that they should kneel down again upon the earth, and also that his disciples should kneel down upon the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon the earth, he commanded his disciples that they should pray.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus, calling him their Lord and their God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of the midst of them, and went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth, and he said:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me that I have chosen them out of the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost because they believe in me; and thou seest that they believe in me because thou hearest them, and they pray unto me; and they pray unto me because I am with them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and also for all those who shall believe on their words, that they may believe in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not multiply many words, for it was given unto them what they should pray, and they were filled with desire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him; and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light of his countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as white as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And Jesus said unto them: Pray on; nevertheless they did not cease to pray.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And he turned from them again, and went a little way off and bowed himself to the earth; and he prayed again unto the Father, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I have chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them, and also for them who shall believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith on their words, even as they are purified in me.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Father, I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me out of the world, because of their faith, that they may be purified in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one, that I may be glorified in them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And when Jesus had spoken these words he came again unto his disciples; and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing, unto him; and he did smile upon them again; and behold they were white, even as Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that he went again a little way off and prayed unto the Father;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, neither can be written by man the words which he prayed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Nevertheless, so great and marvelous were the words which he prayed that they cannot be written, neither can they be uttered by man.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying he came again to the disciples, and said unto them: So great faith have I never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I could not show unto them so great miracles, because of their unbelief.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_19.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Verily I say unto you, there are none of them that have seen so great things as ye have seen; neither have they heard so great things as ye have heard.</li>

But even those of us who have never lived the law of Moses can recognize that the standard Jesus set for His disciples is a high one. &#x201C;I would that ye should be perfect,&#x201D; He declared (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p48#p48">3&#xA0;Nephi 12:48</a>). If this makes you feel inadequate, remember that Jesus also said, &#x201C;Blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">3&#xA0;Nephi 12:3</a>). This higher law is an invitation&#x2014;another way of saying &#x201C;Come unto me and be ye saved&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p20#p20">3&#xA0;Nephi 12:20</a>). Like the law of Moses, this law points us to Christ&#x2014;the only One who can save and perfect us. &#x201C;Behold,&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I am the law, and the light. Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p9#p9">3&#xA0;Nephi 15:9</a>).</p>

They could also substitute their names for &#x201C;wise man&#x201D; as they read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p24-p27#p24">3&#xA0;Nephi 14:24&#x2013;27</a> or sing &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/childrens-songbook/the-wise-man-and-the-foolish-man?lang=eng">The Wise Man and the Foolish Man</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Children&#x2019;s Songbook</cite>, 281).

Invite your children to try to balance only on their &#x201C;hearing&#x201D; leg. What would happen if a strong wind blew through the room? Then you and your children could look for specific things the Savior taught us to do: see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p3-p12,21-p26#p3">3&#xA0;Nephi 12:3&#x2013;12, 21&#x2013;26</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p8#p5">13:5&#x2013;8</a>.</p>

<p data-aid="154411363" id="p1">In some ways, it was an exciting time to be a believer in Jesus Christ. Prophecies were being fulfilled&#x2014;great signs and miracles among the people indicated that the Savior would soon be born. On the other hand, it was also an anxious time for believers because, in spite of all the miracles, unbelievers insisted that &#x201C;the time was past&#x201D; for the Savior to be born (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:5</a>). These people caused &#x201C;a great uproar throughout the land&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:7</a>) and even set a date to kill all the believers if the sign prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite&#x2014;a night without darkness&#x2014;did not appear.</p>
<p data-aid="154411366" id="p2">In these difficult circumstances, the prophet Nephi &#x201C;cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:11</a>). The Lord&#x2019;s response is inspiring to anyone who faces persecution or doubt and needs to know that light will overcome darkness: &#x201C;Lift up your head and be of good cheer; &#x2026; I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:13</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154411438" id="p15">Your Heavenly Father knows that your life will include moments that are difficult, even frightening. But He also wants you to experience joy. Read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p23#p1">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:1&#x2013;23</a> to learn about the reasons the faithful Nephites had to be afraid. What reason did the Lord give them to &#x201C;be of good cheer&#x201D;?</p>
<p data-aid="154411441" id="p16">The Savior has used the phrase &#x201C;be of good cheer&#x201D; on several occasions&#x2014;for example, in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p24-p27#p24">Matthew 14:24&#x2013;27</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p33#p33">John 16:33</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61?lang=eng&amp;id=p36#p36">Doctrine and Covenants 61:36</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78?lang=eng&amp;id=p17-p19#p17">78:17&#x2013;19</a>. What impresses you about these invitations? You might read surrounding verses to understand the circumstances in which the Savior said these words. In each case, what reasons did He give to help people face their fears? How has he done this for you?</p>
<p data-aid="154411443" id="p17">Consider studying President Russell&#xA0;M. Nelson&#x2019;s address &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2016/10/joy-and-spiritual-survival?lang=eng">Joy and Spiritual Survival</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2016, 81&#x2013;84). What does President Nelson teach you about finding joy in any situation? Notice how many times President Nelson uses the word focus. Maybe you could compare focusing a camera or other lens to focusing on Jesus Christ. How will you focus on Him more?</p>

<p data-aid="154411474" id="p22">The Nephites&#x2019; experience with bands of robbers may contain lessons that can help you with the spiritual dangers you face. Look for these lessons in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p12#p11">3&#xA0;Nephi 2:11&#x2013;12</a> and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p26#p1">3:1&#x2013;26</a>. For example, you could search Giddianhi&#x2019;s words in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p2-p10#p2">3&#xA0;Nephi 3:2&#x2013;10</a> and compare them to ways Satan might try to deceive you. What do you learn from the example of Lachoneus?</p>

<p data-aid="154410317" id="p1">The first time Samuel the Lamanite tried to share &#x201C;glad tidings&#x201D; in Zarahemla (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7">Helaman 13:7</a>), he was rejected and cast out by the hard-hearted Nephites. You might say it was as if they had built an impenetrable wall around their hearts that prevented them from receiving Samuel&#x2019;s message. Samuel understood the importance of the message he bore and demonstrated faith by following God&#x2019;s commandment &#x201C;that he should return again, and prophesy&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">Helaman 13:3</a>). Like Samuel, we all encounter walls as we &#x201C;prepare the way of the Lord&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p9#p9">Helaman 14:9</a>) and strive to follow His prophets. And like Samuel, we too bear witness of Jesus Christ, &#x201C;who surely shall come,&#x201D; and invite all to &#x201C;believe on his name&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">Helaman 13:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">14:13</a>). Not everyone will listen, and some may actively oppose us. But those who believe in this message with faith in Christ find that it truly is a message of &#x201C;glad tidings of great joy&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p14#p14">Helaman 16:14</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154410330" id="p2">In the scriptures, prophets are sometimes compared to watchmen on a wall or tower who warn of danger (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/isa/62?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">Isaiah 62:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p7#p1">Ezekiel 33:1&#x2013;7</a>). As you study Samuel&#x2019;s words in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng">Helaman&#xA0;13</a>, consider how he is like a watchman for you. What did he say that seems relevant to our day? (see especially <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p8,21-p22,26-p29,31,38#p8">verses 8, 21&#x2013;22, 26&#x2013;29,&#xA0;31, and&#xA0;38</a>). For example, what did Samuel teach about repentance? about humility and wealth? about seeking happiness &#x201C;in doing iniquity&#x201D;?</p>
<p data-aid="154410332" id="p3">You might also search recent conference messages for similar warnings the Lord has given through modern prophets. What do you feel inspired to do about these warnings?</p>

<p data-aid="154410335" id="figure2_p1"><strong>Look for patterns.</strong> A pattern is a plan or model that can be used as a guide for accomplishing a task. In the scriptures, we find patterns that show how the Lord accomplishes His work, such as sending His servants to warn the people.</p>

<p data-aid="154410348" id="p4">Samuel&#x2019;s warnings of the judgments of God consistently included a merciful invitation to repent. Look for these invitations throughout <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng">Helaman 13&#x2013;15</a> (see especially <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p11#p6">Helaman 13:6&#x2013;11</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p19#p15">14:15&#x2013;19</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p7-p8#p7">15:7&#x2013;8</a>). What do you learn from these verses about repentance? Some people see repentance as a harsh punishment&#x2014;something to avoid. In your opinion, how did Samuel want the Nephites to see repentance?</p>
<p data-aid="154410352" id="p5">To deepen your study, you could read President Russell&#xA0;M. Nelson&#x2019;s message &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson?lang=eng">We Can Do Better and Be Better</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, May 2019, 67). How does he define repentance? What blessings of sincere repentance do you find in his message? You might also look for specific things the prophet invited us to change. What is the Holy Ghost telling you that you need to change? Consider writing down the personal revelation you receive.</p>
<p data-aid="154410356" id="p6">How is repentance different than just changing your behavior? Why is it important to accept God&#x2019;s invitation to repent? As you ponder this, consider singing or listening to a hymn that expresses this invitation, such as &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/how-gentle-gods-commands?lang=eng">How Gentle God&#x2019;s Commands</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;125).</p>

<p data-aid="154410477" id="p15">How can you teach your children that God can speak to our heart, as He did for Samuel? Perhaps you could ask them to show you different ways to communicate without words (such as gestures or facial expressions). This could lead to a discussion about different ways that Heavenly Father communicates with us. As part of this discussion, you and your children could look at a picture of Samuel the Lamanite (this outline has two) and read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p2-p5#p2">Helaman 13:2&#x2013;5</a> as your children listen for how God told Samuel what to say.</p>

<p data-aid="154410484" id="p16">Many of us&#x2014;especially children&#x2014;need help learning to recognize <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> God is speaking to us. You might tell your children about a time when the Holy Ghost helped you know in your heart what God wanted you to do or say. Explain how you knew that God was communicating with you. Perhaps your children could also share any similar experiences they have had.</p>

<p data-aid="154410536" id="p18">You can build your children&#x2019;s trust in the prophet by showing them examples of people who were faithful. Some of these are found in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p1,5#p1">Helaman 16:1,&#xA0;5</a>. As you read, your children could stand up when they hear something the people did when they believed Samuel&#x2019;s words. Then, as you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p2,6#p2">verses&#xA0;2 and&#xA0;6</a>, your children could sit down when they hear something the people did when they did not believe. How can we show that we believe the words of the living prophet? Tell the children how you are blessed as you follow the Lord&#x2019;s counsel through His prophets.</p>

Holland wrote, &#x201C;constituted the focal point, the supreme moment, in the entire history of the Book of Mormon. It was the manifestation and the decree that had informed and inspired every Nephite prophet. &#x2026; Everyone had talked of him, sung of him, dreamed of him, and prayed for his appearance&#x2014;but here he actually was. The day of days! The God who turns every dark night into morning light had arrived&#x201D; (<cite>Christ and the New Covenant</cite> [1997], 250&#x2013;51).</p>
