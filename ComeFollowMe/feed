            <li id="mosiah_22.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to consult with the people how they should deliver themselves out of bondage; and even they did cause that all the people should gather themselves together; and this they did that they might have the voice of the people concerning the matter.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver themselves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and children, and their flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and depart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so numerous, it was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them, thinking to deliver themselves out of bondage by the sword.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and stood before the king, and said unto him: Now O king, thou hast hitherto hearkened unto my words many times when we have been contending with our brethren, the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be an unprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even so I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time, and I will be thy servant and deliver this people out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the king granted unto him that he might speak.  And Gideon said unto him:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of the city.  The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by night are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And I will go according to thy command and pay the last tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and we will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp when they are drunken and asleep.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our flocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel around the land of Shilom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of Gideon.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And king Limhi caused that his people should gather their flocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto them; and they did drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart by night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds, and they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And they had taken all their gold, and silver, and their precious things, which they could carry, and also their provisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their journey.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And after being many days in the wilderness they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah&#x2019;s people, and became his subjects.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and he also received their records, and also the records which had been found by the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the people of Limhi had departed out of the land by night, that they sent an army into the wilderness to pursue them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after they had pursued them two days, they could no longer follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in the wilderness.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_23.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord that the armies of king Noah would come upon them, and having made it known to his people, therefore they gathered together their flocks, and took of their grain, and departed into the wilderness before the armies of king Noah.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the Lord did strengthen them, that the people of king Noah could not overtake them to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they fled eight days&#x2019; journey into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and pleasant land, a land of pure water.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground, and began to build buildings; yea, they were industrious, and did labor exceedingly.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the people were desirous that Alma should be their king, for he was beloved by his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye should have a king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could always have just men to be your kings it would be well for you to have a king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his priests; and I myself was caught in a snare, and did many things which were abominable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore repentance;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Nevertheless, after much tribulation, the Lord did hear my cries, and did answer my prayers, and has made me an instrument in his hands in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his truth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, in this I do not glory, for I am unworthy to glory of myself.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And also trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man should love his neighbor as himself, that there should be no contention among them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, Alma was their high priest, he being the founder of their church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that none received authority to preach or to teach except it were by him from God.  Therefore he consecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none were consecrated except they were just men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Therefore they did watch over their people, and did nourish them with things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in the land; and they called the land Helam.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that they did multiply and prosper exceedingly in the land of Helam; and they built a city, which they called the city of Helam.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Nevertheless&#x2014;whosoever putteth his trust in him the same shall be lifted up at the last day.  Yea, and thus it was with this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, I will show unto you that they were brought into bondage, and none could deliver them but the Lord their God, yea, even the God of Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that he did deliver them, and he did show forth his mighty power unto them, and great were their rejoicings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For behold, it came to pass that while they were in the land of Helam, yea, in the city of Helam, while tilling the land round about, behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma fled from their fields, and gathered themselves together in the city of Helam; and they were much frightened because of the appearance of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened, but that they should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they would spare them, and their wives, and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites.  And Alma and his brethren went forth and delivered themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession of the land of Helam.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Now the armies of the Lamanites, which had followed after the people of king Limhi, had been lost in the wilderness for many days.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And behold, they had found those priests of king Noah, in a place which they called Amulon; and they had begun to possess the land of Amulon and had begun to till the ground.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now the name of the leader of those priests was Amulon.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that Amulon did plead with the Lamanites; and he also sent forth their wives, who were the daughters of the Lamanites, to plead with their brethren, that they should not destroy their husbands.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And the Lamanites had compassion on Amulon and his brethren, and did not destroy them, because of their wives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And Amulon and his brethren did join the Lamanites, and they were traveling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi when they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and his brethren, that if they would show them the way which led to the land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and their liberty.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But after Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of Nephi the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set guards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a part of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with them the wives and the children of the guards who had been left in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the land of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do anything contrary to the will of the king of the Lamanites.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_25.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now king Mosiah caused that all the people should be gathered together.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now there were not so many of the children of Nephi, or so many of those who were descendants of Nephi, as there were of the people of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who came with him into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And there were not so many of the people of Nephi and of the people of Zarahemla as there were of the Lamanites; yea, they were not half so numerous.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now all the people of Nephi were assembled together, and also all the people of Zarahemla, and they were gathered together in two bodies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be read, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the records of the people of Zeniff, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until they returned again.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he also read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all their afflictions, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until the time they returned again.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading the records, his people who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and amazement.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those that had been delivered out of bondage they were filled with exceedingly great joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again, when they thought of their brethren who had been slain by the Lamanites they were filled with sorrow, and even shed many tears of sorrow.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites and of bondage, they did raise their voices and give thanks to God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again, when they thought upon the Lamanites, who were their brethren, of their sinful and polluted state, they were filled with pain and anguish for the welfare of their souls.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that those who were the children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the daughters of the Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those who were called Nephites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now all the people of Zarahemla were numbered with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but those who were descendants of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should also speak to the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled together in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all those that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people many things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king Limhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people were desirous that they might be baptized also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that he might establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now this was done because there were so many people that they could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God in one assembly;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Therefore they did assemble themselves together in different bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were all one church, yea, even the church of God; for there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of God;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And they were called the people of God.  And the Lord did pour out his Spirit upon them, and they were blessed, and prospered in the land.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_21.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that Limhi and his people returned to the city of Nephi, and began to dwell in the land again in peace.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that after many days the Lamanites began again to be stirred up in anger against the Nephites, and they began to come into the borders of the land round about.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_21.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now the afflictions of the Nephites were great, and there was no way that they could deliver themselves out of their hands, for the Lamanites had surrounded them on every side.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that the people began to murmur with the king because of their afflictions; and they began to be desirous to go against them to battle.  And they did afflict the king sorely with their complaints; therefore he granted unto them that they should do according to their desires.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they gathered themselves together again, and put on their armor, and went forth against the Lamanites to drive them out of their land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat them, and drove them back, and slew many of them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now there was a great mourning and lamentation among the people of Limhi, the widow mourning for her husband, the son and the daughter mourning for their father, and the brothers for their brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now there were a great many widows in the land, and they did cry mightily from day to day, for a great fear of the Lamanites had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up the remainder of the people of Limhi to anger against the Lamanites; and they went again to battle, but they were driven back again, suffering much loss.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, they went again even the third time, and suffered in the like manner; and those that were not slain returned again to the city of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And they did humble themselves even to the dust, subjecting themselves to the yoke of bondage, submitting themselves to be smitten, and to be driven to and fro, and burdened, according to the desires of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they did humble themselves even in the depths of humility; and they did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day long did they cry unto their God that he would deliver them out of their afflictions.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease their burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that they began to prosper by degrees in the land, and began to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks, and herds, that they did not suffer with hunger.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of men; therefore king Limhi commanded that every man should impart to the support of the widows and their children, that they might not perish with hunger; and this they did because of the greatness of their number that had been slain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now the people of Limhi kept together in a body as much as it was possible, and secured their grain and their flocks;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And the king himself did not trust his person without the walls of the city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing that he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And he caused that his people should watch the land round about, that by some means they might take those priests that fled into the wilderness, who had stolen the daughters of the Lamanites, and that had caused such a great destruction to come upon them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> For they were desirous to take them that they might punish them; for they had come into the land of Nephi by night, and carried off their grain and many of their precious things; therefore they laid wait for them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that there was no more disturbance between the Lamanites and the people of Limhi, even until the time that Ammon and his brethren came into the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the king having been without the gates of the city with his guard, discovered Ammon and his brethren; and supposing them to be priests of Noah therefore he caused that they should be taken, and bound, and cast into prison.  And had they been the priests of Noah he would have caused that they should be put to death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> But when he found that they were not, but that they were his brethren, and had come from the land of Zarahemla, he was filled with exceedingly great joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now king Limhi had sent, previous to the coming of Ammon, a small number of men to search for the land of Zarahemla; but they could not find it, and they were lost in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled; yea, a land which was covered with dry bones; yea, a land which had been peopled and which had been destroyed; and they, having supposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of Nephi, having arrived in the borders of the land not many days before the coming of Ammon.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And they brought a record with them, even a record of the people whose bones they had found; and it was engraven on plates of ore.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now Limhi was again filled with joy on learning from the mouth of Ammon that king Mosiah had a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such engravings; yea, and Ammon also did rejoice.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yet Ammon and his brethren were filled with sorrow because so many of their brethren had been slain;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also did mourn for the death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of Alma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the words which had been spoken by Abinadi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not whither they had fled.  Now they would have gladly joined with them, for they themselves had entered into a covenant with God to serve him and keep his commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now since the coming of Ammon, king Limhi had also entered into a covenant with God, and also many of his people, to serve him and keep his commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of his people were desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that had authority from God.  And Ammon declined doing this thing, considering himself an unworthy servant.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a church, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord.  Now they were desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> They were desirous to be baptized as a witness and a testimony that they were willing to serve God with all their hearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time; and an account of their baptism shall be given hereafter.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And now all the study of Ammon and his people, and king Limhi and his people, was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the Lamanites and from bondage.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_20.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now there was a place in Shemlon where the daughters of the Lamanites did gather themselves together to sing, and to dance, and to make themselves merry.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that there was one day a small number of them gathered together to sing and to dance.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now the priests of king Noah, being ashamed to return to the city of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that the people would slay them, therefore they durst not return to their wives and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And having tarried in the wilderness, and having discovered the daughters of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when there were but few of them gathered together to dance, they came forth out of their secret places and took them and carried them into the wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the daughters of the Lamanites they carried into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that their daughters had been missing, they were angry with the people of Limhi, for they thought it was the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea, even the king himself went before his people; and they went up to the land of Nephi to destroy the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now Limhi had discovered them from the tower, even all their preparations for war did he discover; therefore he gathered his people together, and laid wait for them in the fields and in the forests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had come up, that the people of Limhi began to fall upon them from their waiting places, and began to slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the battle became exceedingly sore, for they fought like lions for their prey.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as the Lamanites.  But they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites among the number of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him before Limhi, and said: Behold, here is the king of the Lamanites; he having received a wound has fallen among their dead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him before you; and now let us slay him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring him hither that I may see him.  And they brought him.  And Limhi said unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my people?  Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now the king said: I have broken the oath because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter; therefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever has done this thing shall perish.  Therefore he caused a search to be made among his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now when Gideon had heard these things, he being the king&#x2019;s captain, he went forth and said unto the king: I pray thee forbear, and do not search this people, and lay not this thing to their charge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, whom this people sought to destroy?  And are they not in the wilderness?  And are not they the ones who have stolen the daughters of the Lamanites?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, behold, and tell the king of these things, that he may tell his people that they may be pacified towards us; for behold they are already preparing to come against us; and behold also there are but few of us.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, they come with their numerous hosts; and except the king doth pacify them towards us we must perish.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled, which he prophesied against us&#x2014;and all this because we would not hearken unto the words of the Lord, and turn from our iniquities?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil the oath which we have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in bondage than that we should lose our lives; therefore, let us put a stop to the shedding of so much blood.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now Limhi told the king all the things concerning his father, and the priests that had fled into the wilderness, and attributed the carrying away of their daughters to them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that the king was pacified towards his people; and he said unto them: Let us go forth to meet my people, without arms; and I swear unto you with an oath that my people shall not slay thy people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went forth without arms to meet the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites did bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi, that they were without arms, they had compassion on them and were pacified towards them, and returned with their king in peace to their own land.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_24.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed teachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the land of Amulon.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For the Lamanites had taken possession of all these lands; therefore, the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over all these lands.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now the name of the king of the Lamanites was Laman, being called after the name of his father; and therefore he was called king Laman.  And he was king over a numerous people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he appointed teachers of the brethren of Amulon in every land which was possessed by his people; and thus the language of Nephi began to be taught among all the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they were a people friendly one with another; nevertheless they knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them anything concerning the Lord their God, neither the law of Moses; nor did they teach them the words of Abinadi;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But they taught them that they should keep their record, and that they might write one to another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began to trade one with another and wax great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were among their own brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now it came to pass that Amulon began to exercise authority over Alma and his brethren, and began to persecute him, and cause that his children should persecute their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king&#x2019;s priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth with him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put task-masters over them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he put guards over them to watch them, that whosoever should be found calling upon God should be put to death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go before this people, and I will go with thee and deliver this people out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now it came to pass that Alma and his people in the night-time gathered their flocks together, and also of their grain; yea, even all the night-time were they gathering their flocks together.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon the Lamanites, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound sleep.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And Alma and his people departed into the wilderness; and when they had traveled all day they pitched their tents in a valley, and they called the valley Alma, because he led their way in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their thanks to God because he had been merciful unto them, and eased their burdens, and had delivered them out of bondage; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it were the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And they gave thanks to God, yea, all their men and all their women and all their children that could speak lifted their voices in the praises of their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and get thou and this people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will stop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in pursuit of this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that they departed out of the valley, and took their journey into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And after they had been in the wilderness twelve days they arrived in the land of Zarahemla; and king Mosiah did also receive them with joy.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_26.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the church.  And they were a separate people as to their faith, and remained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state; for they would not call upon the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous as the people of God; but because of the dissensions among the brethren they became more numerous.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their flattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by the church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests, and delivered up unto the priests by the teachers; and the priests brought them before Alma, who was the high priest.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that Alma did not know concerning them; but there were many witnesses against them; yea, the people stood and testified of their iniquity in abundance.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now there had not any such thing happened before in the church; therefore Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have brought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and they have been taken in divers iniquities.  And they do not repent of their iniquities; therefore we have brought them before thee, that thou mayest judge them according to their crimes.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge them not; therefore I deliver them into thy hands to be judged.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this matter, for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole soul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Blessed art thou, Alma, and blessed are they who were baptized in the waters of Mormon.  Thou art blessed because of thy exceeding faith in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And blessed are they because of their exceeding faith in the words alone which thou hast spoken unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And blessed art thou because thou hast established a church among this people; and they shall be established, and they shall be my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name; for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And because thou hast inquired of me concerning the transgressor, thou art blessed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt have eternal life; and thou shalt serve me and go forth in my name, and shalt gather together my sheep.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he that will hear my voice shall be my sheep; and him shall ye receive into the church, and him will I also receive.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> For behold, this is my church; whosoever is baptized shall be baptized unto repentance.  And whomsoever ye receive shall believe in my name; and him will I freely forgive.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is I that hath created them; and it is I that granteth unto him that believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, in my name are they called; and if they know me they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my right hand.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it shall come to pass that when the second trump shall sound then shall they that never knew me come forth and shall stand before me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, that I am their Redeemer; but they would not be redeemed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And then I will confess unto them that I never knew them; and they shall depart into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I will not receive at the last day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses; for verily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor&#x2019;s trespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemnation.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered among my people; and this shall be observed from this time forward.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass when Alma had heard these words he wrote them down that he might have them, and that he might judge the people of that church according to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Alma went and judged those that had been taken in iniquity, according to the word of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And whosoever repented of their sins and did confess them, them he did number among the people of the church;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And those that would not confess their sins and repent of their iniquity, the same were not numbered among the people of the church, and their names were blotted out.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of the church; and they began again to have peace and to prosper exceedingly in the affairs of the church, walking circumspectly before God, receiving many, and baptizing many.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And now all these things did Alma and his fellow laborers do who were over the church, walking in all diligence, teaching the word of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being persecuted by all those who did not belong to the church of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And they did admonish their brethren; and they were also admonished, every one by the word of God, according to his sins, or to the sins which he had committed, being commanded of God to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_27.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that the persecutions which were inflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma.  And Alma laid the case before their king, Mosiah.  And Mosiah consulted with his priests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the land round about that there should not any unbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And there was a strict command throughout all the churches that there should be no persecutions among them, that there should be an equality among all men;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> That they should let no pride nor haughtiness disturb their peace; that every man should esteem his neighbor as himself, laboring with their own hands for their support.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and all their priests and teachers should labor with their own hands for their support, in all cases save it were in sickness, or in much want; and doing these things, they did abound in the grace of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the people began to be very numerous, and began to scatter abroad upon the face of the earth, yea, on the north and on the south, on the east and on the west, building large cities and villages in all quarters of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the Lord did visit them and prosper them, and they became a large and wealthy people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man.  And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now it came to pass that while he was going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God?  For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God?  For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth?  And can ye not also behold me before you?  And I am sent from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in bondage, and he has delivered them.  And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now it came to pass that these were the last words which the angel spake unto Alma, and he departed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the earth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together that they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for those that were with him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might receive their strength&#x2014;that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity.  I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God.  My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto all.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him.  Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And how blessed are they!  For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_28.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners.  And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that Mosiah granted that they might go and do according to their request.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And they took their journey into the wilderness to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an account of their proceedings hereafter.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who would accept of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and all the things which he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of God, after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the plates of gold which had been found by the people of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people; for they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those people who had been destroyed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now he translated them by the means of those two stones which were fastened into the two rims of a bow.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now these things were prepared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And they have been kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he should discover to every creature who should possess the land the iniquities and abominations of his people;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And whosoever has these things is called seer, after the manner of old times.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records, behold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And this account shall be written hereafter; for behold, it is expedient that all people should know the things which are written in this account.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_29.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now when Mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the land, among all the people, desiring to know their will concerning who should be their king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: We are desirous that Aaron thy son should be our king and our ruler.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the sons of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the people; yea, even a written word sent he among the people.  And these were the words that were written, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren, for I esteem you as such, I desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are called to consider&#x2014;for ye are desirous to have a king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now I declare unto you that he to whom the kingdom doth rightly belong has declined, and will not take upon him the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now if there should be another appointed in his stead, behold I fear there would rise contentions among you.  And who knoweth but what my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn to be angry and draw away a part of this people after him, which would cause wars and contentions among you, which would be the cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the Lord, yea, and destroy the souls of many people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider these things, for we have no right to destroy my son, neither should we have any right to destroy another if he should be appointed in his stead.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to commit much sin.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now let us be wise and look forward to these things, and do that which will make for the peace of this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore I will be your king the remainder of my days; nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this people according to our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of this people, for we will appoint wise men to be judges, that will judge this people according to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now it is better that a man should be judged of God than of man, for the judgments of God are always just, but the judgments of man are not always just.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore, if it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings, who would establish the laws of God, and judge this people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did for this people&#x2014;I say unto you, if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And even I myself have labored with all the power and faculties which I have possessed, to teach you the commandments of God, and to establish peace throughout the land, that there should be no wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering, nor murdering, nor any manner of iniquity;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have I punished according to the crime which he has committed, according to the law which has been given to us by our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is not expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked king cause to be committed, yea, and what great destruction!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations, and also the wickedness and abominations of his people.  Behold what great destruction did come upon them; and also because of their iniquities they were brought into bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And were it not for the interposition of their all-wise Creator, and this because of their sincere repentance, they must unavoidably remain in bondage until now.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And behold, now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous king save it be through much contention, and the shedding of much blood.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> For behold, he has his friends in iniquity, and he keepeth his guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned in righteousness before him; and he trampleth under his feet the commandments of God;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his people, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now behold I say unto you, it is not expedient that such abominations should come upon you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers, which are correct, and which were given them by the hand of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law&#x2014;to do your business by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher judge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord; and I command you to do these things, and that ye have no king; that if these people commit sins and iniquities they shall be answered upon their own heads.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For behold I say unto you, the sins of many people have been caused by the iniquities of their kings; therefore their iniquities are answered upon the heads of their kings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now I desire that this inequality should be no more in this land, especially among this my people; but I desire that this land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we may live and inherit the land, yea, even as long as any of our posterity remains upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them, unfolding unto them all the trials and troubles of a righteous king, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also all the murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained it all unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And he told them that these things ought not to be; but that the burden should come upon all the people, that every man might bear his part.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And he also unfolded unto them all the disadvantages they labored under, by having an unrighteous king to rule over them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Yea, all his iniquities and abominations, and all the wars, and contentions, and bloodshed, and the stealing, and the plundering, and the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of iniquities which cannot be enumerated&#x2014;telling them that these things ought not to be, that they were expressly repugnant to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had sent these things forth among the people they were convinced of the truth of his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Therefore they relinquished their desires for a king, and became exceedingly anxious that every man should have an equal chance throughout all the land; yea, and every man expressed a willingness to answer for his own sins.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Therefore, it came to pass that they assembled themselves together in bodies throughout the land, to cast in their voices concerning who should be their judges, to judge them according to the law which had been given them; and they were exceedingly rejoiced because of the liberty which had been granted unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon him as a tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre which doth corrupt the soul; for he had not exacted riches of them, neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but he had established peace in the land, and he had granted unto his people that they should be delivered from all manner of bondage; therefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And it came to pass that they did appoint judges to rule over them, or to judge them according to the law; and this they did throughout all the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the first chief judge, he being also the high priest, his father having conferred the office upon him, and having given him the charge concerning all the affairs of the church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the ways of the Lord, and he did keep his commandments, and he did judge righteous judgments; and there was continual peace through the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> And thus commenced the reign of the judges throughout all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who were called the Nephites; and Alma was the first and chief judge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And now it came to pass that his father died, being eighty and two years old, having lived to fulfil the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And it came to pass that Mosiah died also, in the thirty and third year of his reign, being sixty and three years old; making in the whole, five hundred and nine years from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> And thus ended the reign of the kings over the people of Nephi; and thus ended the days of Alma, who was the founder of their church.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having gone the way of all the earth, having warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless he had established laws, and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide by the laws which he had made.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of Alma in the judgment-seat, there was a man brought before him to be judged, a man who was large, and was noted for his much strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give him money.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a church after the manner of his preaching.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an instrument in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him.  Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be judged according to the crimes which he had committed.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pled for himself with much boldness.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that priestcraft has been introduced among this people.  And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to spare thee his blood would come upon us for vengeance.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore thou art condemned to die, according to the law which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been acknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by the law.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was Nehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious death.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft through the land; for there were many who loved the vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false doctrines; and this they did for the sake of riches and honor.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of the law, for liars were punished; therefore they pretended to preach according to their belief; and now the law could have no power on any man for his belief.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And they durst not steal, for fear of the law, for such were punished; neither durst they rob, nor murder, for he that murdered was punished unto death.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of God began to persecute those that did belong to the church of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all manner of words, and this because of their humility; because they were not proud in their own eyes, and because they did impart the word of God, one with another, without money and without price.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their fists.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God.  And also many withdrew themselves from among them.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God.  And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need&#x2014;an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites who were not slain by the weapons of war, after having buried those who had been slain&#x2014;now the number of the slain were not numbered, because of the greatness of their number&#x2014;after they had finished burying their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses, and their wives, and their children.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and also many of their flocks and their herds; and also many of their fields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the hosts of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had been slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the waters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the sea, and they are many.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And the Amlicites were distinguished from the Nephites, for they had marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the manner of the Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like unto the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites was called under that head, and there was a mark set upon him.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the tradition of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition of their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the commandments of God and kept them, were called the Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time forth&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it is they who have kept the records which are true of their people, and also of the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a mark set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a mark of red upon their foreheads.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against thee and thy seed.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be called thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be called thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the promises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the words of God when they began to mark themselves in their foreheads; nevertheless they had come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should fall upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own condemnation.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army met the Amlicites.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them out of their land.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up to battle at this time against the Lamanites;</li>
            <li id="alma_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and slew many of the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them out of the borders of their land.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And then they returned again and began to establish peace in the land, being troubled no more for a time with their enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and contentions were commenced and ended in the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards according to their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this according to the words of the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according to the truth.  And thus endeth the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the fifth year of their reign there began to be a contention among the people; for a certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed according to the law&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be a king over the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves together throughout all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in their voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Amlici, that he was not made king over the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor to anger against those who were not in his favor.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together, and did consecrate Amlici to be their king.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he did that he might subject them to him.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici, being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called Nephites, or the people of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons of war, of every kind.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of their coming.  And there were appointed captains, and higher captains, and chief captains, according to their numbers.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all manner of weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against their brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the people of Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidon.  And the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall before the Amlicites.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that they began to flee before them.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all that day, and did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in the valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites, that he might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he might guard himself against them, that he might preserve his people from being destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the Amlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the camp of the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much fear, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_2.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our great astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites; and behold, the Amlicites have joined them;</li>
            <li id="alma_2.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their tents, and departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their city, which was the city of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword, face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with another.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, being exercised with much faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and spare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save and preserve this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici with the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his guards to contend with Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the king of the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river Sidon that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not be numbered.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness which was west and north, away beyond the borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay them.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until they were scattered on the west, and on the north, until they had reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that part of the wilderness which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their wounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped up on the earth.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor wars in the land of Zarahemla;</li>
            <li id="alma_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized.  And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly apparel.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to those who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting themselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their backs upon the needy and the naked and those who were hungry, and those who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people, while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner of afflictions, for Christ&#x2019;s sake, who should come according to the spirit of prophecy;</li>
            <li id="alma_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of their sins; being filled with great joy because of the resurrection of the dead, according to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all their inequality, began to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now this man&#x2019;s name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers?  Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them?  And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God.  Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they were not.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed?  I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love.  And I say unto you that they are saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved?  Yea, what grounds had they to hope for salvation?  What is the cause of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of hell?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Behold, I can tell you&#x2014;did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi?  And was he not a holy prophet?  Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart.  Behold I say unto you that this is all true.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God.  And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God?  Have ye received his image in your countenances?  Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you?  Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that day, and say&#x2014;Lord, our works have been righteous works upon the face of the earth&#x2014;and that he will save you?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands?  I say unto you, can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have yielded yourselves to become subjects to the devil?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments stained with blood and all manner of filthiness?  Behold, what will these things testify against you?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and also that ye are guilty of all manner of wickedness?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose garments are cleansed and are spotless, pure and white?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the children of the kingdom of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble?  That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Behold, are ye stripped of pride?  I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God.  Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy?  I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent, for the Lord God hath spoken it!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life freely;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth not good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye?  Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this?  Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the holy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been spoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And this is not all.  Do ye not suppose that I know of these things myself?  Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true.  And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God.  Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself.  And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto me, that the words which have been spoken by our fathers are true, even so according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me, which is also by the manifestation of the Spirit of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall say unto you, concerning that which is to come, is true; and I say unto you, that I know that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy, and truth.  And behold, it is he that cometh to take away the sins of the world, yea, the sins of every man who steadfastly believeth on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I am called, yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and every one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God cometh in his glory, in his might, majesty, power, and dominion.  Yea, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit saith: Behold the glory of the King of all the earth; and also the King of heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a mighty voice, saying: Go forth and say unto this people&#x2014;Repent, for except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of heaven.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is laid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire.  Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and trample the Holy One under your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing of costly apparel and setting your hearts upon the vain things of the world, upon your riches?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than another; yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your brethren, who humble themselves and do walk after the holy order of God, wherewith they have been brought into this church, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth works which are meet for repentance&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.55" class=""><span class="verse">55</span> Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the poor, and the needy, and in withholding your substance from them?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.56" class=""><span class="verse">56</span> And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I say unto you that these are they who shall be hewn down and cast into the fire except they speedily repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.57" class=""><span class="verse">57</span> And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold, their names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the righteous, that the word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.58" class=""><span class="verse">58</span> For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand.  And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this?  I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.59" class=""><span class="verse">59</span> For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock?  And behold, if a wolf enter his flock doth he not drive him out?  Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.60" class=""><span class="verse">60</span> And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you; and if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you into his fold, and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may not be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.61" class=""><span class="verse">61</span> And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.62" class=""><span class="verse">62</span> I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church who repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance, and were received into the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not repent of their wickedness and humble themselves before God&#x2014;I mean those who were lifted up in the pride of their hearts&#x2014;the same were rejected, and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the city of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was liberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of assembling themselves together to hear the word of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather themselves together oft, and join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church which was established in the valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and the holy order by which he was called.  And thus it is written.  Amen.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 7</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much business that I could not come unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that the judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea, hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that they are established again in the way of his righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading through much affliction and sorrow.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the true and the living God, and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all&#x2014;for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case.  Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying&#x2014;Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things?  Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the way that I know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of the Spirit which is in me.  And now because your faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken, great is my joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found that my desires have been gratified.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that ye are making his paths straight.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of his word, that he cannot walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal round.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can filthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is filthy shall remain in his filthiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have been received.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the holy prophets who have been ever since the world began, having your garments spotless even as their garments are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no more out.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto you according to the Spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul doth exceedingly rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and heed which ye have given unto my word.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess, your women and your children, according to your faith and good works, from this time forth and forever.  And thus I have spoken.  Amen.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 8</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the order of the church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself from the labors which he had performed.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek according to the holy order of God, by which he had been called; and he began to teach the people throughout all the land of Melek.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all the borders of the land which was by the wilderness side. And they were baptized throughout all the land;</li>
            <li id="alma_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and traveled three days&#x2019; journey on the north of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of Ammonihah he began to preach the word of God unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which was called Aaron.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from him.  Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them.  Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will destroy them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has given unto his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah.  And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?</li>
            <li id="alma_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive.  Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this land forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them concerning their iniquities.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many days.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their iniquities.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people, saying&#x2014;Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and cast into prison.  Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had given them.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Who art thou?  Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not that the earth should pass away.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did not.  And I stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of Jerusalem by the hand of God?  Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through the wilderness?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.  But behold, this is not all&#x2014;he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land?  And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence of the Lord.  Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who call on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce anger of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to destroy his people.  I say unto you, Nay; he would rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after having had so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea, after having been favored above every other nation, kindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made known unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which is to come;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of translation;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of things&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people and to answer their prayers.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they have been&#x2014;if they have been righteous they shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are meet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost and a fallen people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a fallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they should take me at that time and cast me into prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to preach unto them also.  And now the words of Amulek are not all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was that same Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the hands of his brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power.  I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house.  And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house&#x2014;and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices&#x2014;yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come down among my people, with equity and justice in my hands.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts?  Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, according to their truth?</li>
            <li id="alma_10.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For behold, have I testified against your law?  Ye do not understand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law.  And now he says that he has not spoken against it.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things against him.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom.  Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their employ.</li>

<p data-aid="154069210" id="p1">Alma did not know about today&#x2019;s lifesaving heart transplant surgeries, which replace a damaged or diseased heart with a healthy one. But he knew about a more miraculous &#x201C;change of heart&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p26#p26">Alma 5:26</a>)&#x2014;one in which the Savior gives us a newness of spiritual life, like being &#x201C;born again&#x201D; (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p14,49#p14">Alma 5:14,&#xA0;49</a>). Alma could see that this change of heart was exactly what many of the Nephites needed. Some were rich and others poor, some prideful and others humble, some persecutors and others afflicted by persecution (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p15#p6">Alma 4:6&#x2013;15</a>). But all of them needed to come unto Jesus Christ to be healed&#x2014;just as we all do. Whether we are seeking to overcome pride or to endure afflictions, Alma&#x2019;s message is the same: &#x201C;Come and fear not&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15">Alma 7:15</a>). Let the Savior change a hardened, sinful, or wounded heart into one that is humble, pure, and new.</p>

<p data-aid="154069420" id="p17">How can you use Alma&#x2019;s description of the path back to Heavenly Father to help your children learn to make good choices?

Help them think of choices that help us stay on the path and other choices that take us off the path. You could also look at pictures of Jesus together and talk about things He did to show us the path back to Heavenly Father.
