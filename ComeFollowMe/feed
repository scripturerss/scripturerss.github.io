        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth.  And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak unto them, saying: My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my people, I would again call your attention, that ye may hear and understand the remainder of my words which I shall speak unto you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And this is the means whereby salvation cometh.  And there is none other salvation save this which hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions which I have told you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that which is his due.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For behold, are we not all beggars?  Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a remission of your sins.  And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain?  Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just will be your condemnation for withholding your substance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing which thou hast done.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall perish with him; and now, I say these things unto those who are rich as pertaining to the things of this world.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you&#x2014;that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God&#x2014;I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength.  And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish.  And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="w of m_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which I have been making into the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have witnessed almost all the destruction of my people, the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I deliver these records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth me that he will witness the entire destruction of my people.  But may God grant that he may survive them, that he may write somewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may profit them.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after I had made an abridgment from the plates of Nephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into my hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small account of the prophets, from Jacob down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me, because of the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my fathers knowing that many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as many things as have been prophesied concerning us down to this day have been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond this day must surely come to pass&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon them, which remainder of my record I shall take from the plates of Nephi; and I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of my people.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, I shall take these plates, which contain these prophesyings and revelations, and put them with the remainder of my record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be choice unto my brethren.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me.  And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may once again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of Christ; that they may once again be a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my record, which I take from the plates of Nephi; and I make it according to the knowledge and the understanding which God has given me.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki had delivered up these plates into the hands of king Benjamin, he took them and put them with the other plates, which contained records which had been handed down by the kings, from generation to generation until the days of king Benjamin.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to generation until they have fallen into my hands.  And I, Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved from this time henceforth.  And I know that they will be preserved; for there are great things written upon them, out of which my people and their brethren shall be judged at the great and last day, according to the word of God which is written.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, concerning this king Benjamin&#x2014;he had somewhat of contentions among his own people.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites came down out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his people.  But behold, king Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he did stand against them; and he did fight with the strength of his own arm, with the sword of Laban.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And in the strength of the Lord they did contend against their enemies, until they had slain many thousands of the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that they did contend against the Lamanites until they had driven them out of all the lands of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that after there had been false Christs, and their mouths had been shut, and they punished according to their crimes;</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after there had been false prophets, and false preachers and teachers among the people, and all these having been punished according to their crimes; and after there having been much contention and many dissensions away unto the Lamanites, behold, it came to pass that king Benjamin, with the assistance of the holy prophets who were among his people&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and he did reign over his people in righteousness; and there were many holy men in the land, and they did speak the word of God with power and with authority; and they did use much sharpness because of the stiffneckedness of the people&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, with the help of these, king Benjamin, by laboring with all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul, and also the prophets, did once more establish peace in the land.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the land, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And there were a great number, even so many that they did not number them; for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they also took of the firstlings of their flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the law of Moses;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had appointed just men to be their teachers, and also a just man to be their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the commandments of God, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For the multitude being so great that king Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of the temple, therefore he caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that he began to speak to his people from the tower; and they could not all hear his words because of the greatness of the multitude; therefore he caused that the words which he spake should be written and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also receive his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And these are the words which he spake and caused to be written, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne&#x2014;and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might boast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can answer a clear conscience before God this day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to serve one another?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king, who has spent his days in your service, and yet has been in the service of God, do merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your heavenly King!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another&#x2014;I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you.  And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves?  I answer you, Nay.  Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust.  And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done.  As ye have kept my commandments, and also the commandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are; and also have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom&#x2019;s paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.  For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.  O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="nano-content">
        <div class="chapterheading">The Book of Enos</div>
        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="enos_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man&#x2014;for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord&#x2014;and blessed be the name of my God for it&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="enos_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before I received a remission of my sins.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And I said: Lord, how is it done?</li>
            <li id="enos_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen.  And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments.  I have given unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said; and their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him&#x2014;that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall into transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites should not be destroyed, that the Lord God would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be brought forth at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be brought unto salvation&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="enos_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring them to the true faith.  And they swore in their wrath that, if it were possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also all the traditions of our fathers.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to preserve our records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto me: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would preserve the records; and he covenanted with me that he would bring them forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And I, Enos, knew it would be according to the covenant which he had made; wherefore my soul did rest.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto thine.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went about among the people of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of the things which I had heard and seen.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God.  But our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax.  And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild goats, and also many horses.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there were exceedingly many prophets among us.  And the people were a stiffnecked people, hard to understand.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And there was nothing save it was exceeding harshness, preaching and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and continually reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and all these things&#x2014;stirring them up continually to keep them in the fear of the Lord.  I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to destruction.  And after this manner do I write concerning them.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And I saw wars between the Nephites and Lamanites in the course of my days.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that I began to be old, and an hundred and seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our father Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been wrought upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy unto this people, and declare the word according to the truth which is in Christ.  And I have declared it in all my days, and have rejoiced in it above that of the world.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest.  And I rejoice in the day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father.  Amen.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 3</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God.  And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he stood before me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against God!  For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he had already come among them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing except it were through the atonement of his blood.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And even if it were possible that little children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come when the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And behold, when that time cometh, none shall be found blameless before God, except it be little children, only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And even at this time, when thou shalt have taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, even then are they found no more blameless in the sight of God, only according to the words which I have spoken unto thee.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath commanded me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright testimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof they shall be judged, every man according to his works, whether they be good, or whether they be evil.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have drunk damnation to their own souls.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have claim on them no more forever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever.  Thus hath the Lord commanded me.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had consecrated his son Mosiah to be a ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the charges concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to teach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God, and to stir them up in remembrance of the oath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they returned, every one, according to their families, to their own houses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And Mosiah began to reign in his father&#x2019;s stead.  And he began to reign in the thirtieth year of his age, making in the whole, about four hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And king Benjamin lived three years and he died.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did keep his commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And king Mosiah did cause his people that they should till the earth.  And he also, himself, did till the earth, that thereby he might not become burdensome to his people, that he might do according to that which his father had done in all things.  And there was no contention among all his people for the space of three years.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude, and rehearse unto them all that had happened unto their brethren from the time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time that he himself came up out of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king Benjamin had taught them, and explained them to the people of king Limhi, so that they might understand all the words which he spake.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return every one unto his own house.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the record of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could interpret languages, and Ammon told him that he could not.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are large, and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly sound.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again, they have brought swords, the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates.  Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate?  For I am desirous that these records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God.  And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the forest.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow they started to go up, having with them one Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man, and a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the wilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they wander.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when they had wandered forty days they came to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched their tents.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the land of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were surrounded by the king&#x2019;s guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were committed to prison.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were again brought before the king, and their bands were loosed; and they stood before the king, and were permitted, or rather commanded, that they should answer the questions which he should ask them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have caused that my guards should have put you to death.  Ye are permitted to speak.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he went forth and bowed himself before the king; and rising again he said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am yet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to speak with boldness;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these bands.  For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive.  And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne.  And now, behold, our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon nor his brethren, but caused that they should go to the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest themselves from the labors of their journey; for they had suffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather themselves together to the temple, to hear the words which he should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves together that he spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be made.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even until now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection or into bondage.  And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, is not this grievous to be borne?  And is not this, our affliction, great?  Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon them.  But behold, they would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among them, even so much that they did shed blood among themselves.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and said that he should take upon him the image of man, and it should be the image after which man was created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was created after the image of God, and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and many more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God upon them.  Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And again, he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the chaff thereof in the whirlwind; and the effect thereof is poison.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And again he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are smitten and afflicted.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of the land of our fathers&#x2019; first inheritance, and having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them&#x2014;but when I saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness, for I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he being an austere and a blood-thirsty man commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Nevertheless, after many days&#x2019; wandering in the wilderness we pitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain, which was near to the land of our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men into the city, in unto the king, that I might know of the disposition of the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my people and possess the land in peace.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I might possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the land, and I and my people went into the land that we might possess it.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of the city, yea, even the walls of the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with neas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and we did begin to multiply and prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to bring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we might possess it.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore it came to pass, that after we had dwelt in the land for the space of twelve years that king Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any means my people should wax strong in the land, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they were desirous to bring us into bondage, that they might glut themselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might feast themselves upon the flocks of our fields.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began to stir up his people that they should contend with my people; therefore there began to be wars and contentions in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of Shilom, when my people were watering and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not overtaken, even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for protection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and my people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle against the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to the Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them out of our land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their dead.  And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two hundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace.  And I caused that there should be weapons of war made of every kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our fathers for many years, yea, for the space of twenty and two years.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all manner of grain and all manner of fruit of every kind.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and cloth of every kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land&#x2014;thus we did have continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son began to reign in his stead.  And he began to stir his people up in rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to come up to battle against my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But I had sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon, that I might discover their preparations, that I might guard against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men armed with bows, and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle about their loins.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children of my people should be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place them in their ranks, every man according to his age.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that we did go up in the strength of the Lord to battle.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength.  Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this&#x2014;Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord&#x2014;therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And his brethren were wroth with him because they understood not the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And again, they were wroth with him when they had arrived in the promised land, because they said that he had taken the ruling of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into the wilderness as the Lord had commanded him, and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he robbed them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus they have taught their children that they should hate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy them; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our land; and we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not number them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that we returned again to our own land, and my people again began to tend their flocks, and to till their ground.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I, being old, did confer the kingdom upon one of my sons; therefore, I say no more.  And may the Lord bless my people.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="omni_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, it came to pass that I, Omni, being commanded by my father, Jarom, that I should write somewhat upon these plates, to preserve our genealogy&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="omni_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should know that I fought much with the sword to preserve my people, the Nephites, from falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites.  But behold, I of myself am a wicked man, and I have not kept the statutes and the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have done.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that two hundred and seventy and six years had passed away, and we had many seasons of peace; and we had many seasons of serious war and bloodshed.  Yea, and in fine, two hundred and eighty and two years had passed away, and I had kept these plates according to the commandments of my fathers; and I conferred them upon my son Amaron.  And I make an end.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now I, Amaron, write the things whatsoever I write, which are few, in the book of my father.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, it came to pass that three hundred and twenty years had passed away, and the more wicked part of the Nephites were destroyed.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For the Lord would not suffer, after he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from falling into the hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suffer that the words should not be verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall not prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great judgment; nevertheless, he did spare the righteous that they should not perish, but did deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my brother Chemish.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same book with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which he wrote, that he wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day that he delivered them unto me.  And after this manner we keep the records, for it is according to the commandments of our fathers.  And I make an end.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I, Abinadom, am the son of Chemish.  Behold, it came to pass that I saw much war and contention between my people, the Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword, have taken the lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my brethren.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, the record of this people is engraven upon plates which is had by the kings, according to the generations; and I know of no revelation save that which has been written, neither prophecy; wherefore, that which is sufficient is written. And I make an end.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom.  Behold, I will speak unto you somewhat concerning Mosiah, who was made king over the land of Zarahemla; for behold, he being warned of the Lord that he should flee out of the land of Nephi, and as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord should also depart out of the land with him, into the wilderness&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="omni_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he did according as the Lord had commanded him.  And they departed out of the land into the wilderness, as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord; and they were led by many preachings and prophesyings.  And they were admonished continually by the word of God; and they were led by the power of his arm, through the wilderness until they came down into the land which is called the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they discovered a people, who were called the people of Zarahemla.  Now, there was great rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla; and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the plates of brass which contained the record of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah discovered that the people of Zarahemla came out from Jerusalem at the time that Zedekiah, king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And they journeyed in the wilderness, and were brought by the hand of the Lord across the great waters, into the land where Mosiah discovered them; and they had dwelt there from that time forth.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, they had become exceedingly numerous.  Nevertheless, they had had many wars and serious contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to time; and their language had become corrupted; and they had brought no records with them; and they denied the being of their Creator; and Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could understand them.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be taught in his language.  And it came to pass that after they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers, according to his memory; and they are written, but not in these plates.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah, did unite together; and Mosiah was appointed to be their king.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah, there was a large stone brought unto him with engravings on it; and he did interpret the engravings by the gift and power of God.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of his people.  And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla; and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> It also spake a few words concerning his fathers.  And his first parents came out from the tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people; and the severity of the Lord fell upon them according to his judgments, which are just; and their bones lay scattered in the land northward.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I have lived to see his death; and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in his stead.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And behold, I have seen, in the days of king Benjamin, a serious war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the Lamanites.  But behold, the Nephites did obtain much advantage over them; yea, insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no seed, and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord, wherefore, I shall deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting all men to come unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in prophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of angels, and in the gift of speaking with tongues, and in the gift of interpreting languages, and in all things which are good; for there is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord; and that which is evil cometh from the devil.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption.  Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now I would speak somewhat concerning a certain number who went up into the wilderness to return to the land of Nephi; for there was a large number who were desirous to possess the land of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Wherefore, they went up into the wilderness.  And their leader being a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man, wherefore he caused a contention among them; and they were all slain, save fifty, in the wilderness, and they returned again to the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that they also took others to a considerable number, and took their journey again into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And I, Amaleki, had a brother, who also went with them; and I have not since known concerning them.  And I am about to lie down in my grave; and these plates are full.  And I make an end of my speaking.</li>

        <div class="chapterheading">The Book of Jarom</div>
        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jarom_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words according to the commandment of my father, Enos, that our genealogy may be kept.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And as these plates are small, and as these things are written for the intent of the benefit of our brethren the Lamanites, wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall not write the things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations.  For what could I write more than my fathers have written?  For have not they revealed the plan of salvation?  I say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the stiffness of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly merciful unto them, and has not as yet swept them off from the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And there are many among us who have many revelations, for they are not all stiffnecked.  And as many as are not stiffnecked and have faith, have communion with the Holy Spirit, which maketh manifest unto the children of men, according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in the land.  They observed to keep the law of Moses and the sabbath day holy unto the Lord.  And they profaned not; neither did they blaspheme.  And the laws of the land were exceedingly strict.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and the Lamanites also.  And they were exceedingly more numerous than were they of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink the blood of beasts.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the Nephites, to battle.  But our kings and our leaders were mighty men in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways of the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them away out of our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever place of our inheritance.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the land, and became exceedingly rich in gold, and in silver, and in precious things, and in fine workmanship of wood, in buildings, and in machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and steel, making all manner of tools of every kind to till the ground, and weapons of war&#x2014;yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for war.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not prosper against us.  But the word of the Lord was verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did threaten the people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that if they did not keep the commandments, but should fall into transgression, they should be destroyed from off the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers, did labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the people to diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent for which it was given; persuading them to look forward unto the Messiah, and believe in him to come as though he already was.  And after this manner did they teach them.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from being destroyed upon the face of the land; for they did prick their hearts with the word, continually stirring them up unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that two hundred and thirty and eight years had passed away&#x2014;after the manner of wars, and contentions, and dissensions, for the space of much of the time.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small.  But behold, my brethren, ye can go to the other plates of Nephi; for behold, upon them the records of our wars are engraven, according to the writings of the kings, or those which they caused to be written.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And I deliver these plates into the hands of my son Omni, that they may be kept according to the commandments of my fathers.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman.  And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true.  And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of teaching his sons, that he waxed old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this people, whom the Lord our God hath given us.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out, except it be through transgression.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored people of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become weak like unto their brethren; and he will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of these sayings to his son, that he gave him charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the plates of Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor progress in their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his father had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the people who were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather themselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words which his father should speak unto them.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his people if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it is the faith which we have had on the things which our king has spoken unto us that has brought us to this great knowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such exceedingly great joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not bring upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as has been spoken by the angel, that we may not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free.  There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be called by some other name; therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the name that I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him?  I say unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him out.  I say unto you, that even so shall it be among you if ye know not the name by which ye are called.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all.  Amen.</li>

<p data-aid="154070512" id="p1">There are many, many people who haven&#x2019;t yet heard the gospel of Jesus Christ. If you ever feel overwhelmed by the immensity of the task of gathering them into the Lord&#x2019;s Church, what Jacob said about olive trees in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a> has a reassuring reminder: the vineyard belongs to the Lord. He has given each of us a small area to assist in His work&#x2014;our family, our circle of friends, our sphere of influence. And sometimes the first person we help gather is ourselves. But we are never alone in this work, for the Lord of the vineyard labors alongside His servants (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p72#p72">Jacob 5:72</a>). God knows and loves His children, and He will prepare a way for each of them to hear His gospel, even those who have rejected Him in the past (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p18#p15">Jacob 4:15&#x2013;18</a>).

<p data-aid="154070562" id="p2"><a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a> is a story with symbolic meaning. It describes trees and fruit and laborers, but it&#x2019;s really about God&#x2019;s interactions with His people throughout history. So as you read the basic story, think about what some of the things in the story might symbolize.</p>
<p data-aid="154070576" id="p3">For example, if the vineyard represents the world, and the tame olive tree represents Israel (or those who have made covenants with God; see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">Jacob 5:3</a>), what might the wild olive trees represent? What could the good and bad fruit represent? What other symbols do you see?</p>
<p data-aid="154070590" id="p4">Even though <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a> teaches about nations and centuries of world history, it&#x2019;s also about you and your life. What messages do you find for yourself in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a>?</p>

Maybe you could think of a personal experience in which you felt joy while serving the Lord of the vineyard&#x2014;for example, through sharing the gospel, serving in the temple, or strengthening others.

<p data-aid="154070834" id="p15">How can you share the story of the olive trees in a way that your children can understand? One way is to take a walk outside to look at a tree and briefly review the main points of the story. What did the Lord of the vineyard do for His trees? How can we be like workers in the story and help others feel the Savior&#x2019;s love?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070842" id="p16">Jacob shared the story of the olive trees to invite his people to come unto Christ. It can do the same for your children. Perhaps you could summarize the story with verses such as <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p3-p4,28-p29,47,70-p72#p3">Jacob 5:3&#x2013;4, 28&#x2013;29, 47, and 70&#x2013;72</a> (see also &#x201C;Old Testament Olive Vineyard&#x201D; [video], Gospel Library). You or your children could then read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p11,41,47,72#p11">Jacob 5:11, 41, 47, and&#xA0;72</a>, looking for things that show how much the Lord of the vineyard (Jesus Christ) cared about the trees. What does the Savior do to show that He cares about us?</p>

In <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1?lang=eng">Mosiah&#xA0;1&#x2013;3</a>, you will read about a different kind of king. Rather than living off the labors of his people, King Benjamin &#x201C;labored with [his] own hands&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p14#p14">Mosiah 2:14</a>). Instead of having others serve him, he served his people &#x201C;with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord [had] granted unto [him]&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">Mosiah 2:11</a>). This king did not want his people to worship him; rather, he taught them to worship their Heavenly King, Jesus Christ. King Benjamin understood that it is &#x201C;the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Mosiah 3:5</a>), who came &#x201C;down from heaven&#x201D; and went &#x201C;forth amongst men, &#x2026; that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p5,9#p5">Mosiah 3:5,&#xA0;9</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154069188" id="p3">What do you think King Benjamin would say if you asked him why he served with all his &#x201C;might, mind and strength&#x201D;? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">Mosiah 2:11</a>). Ponder this as you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p10-p26#p10">Mosiah 2:10&#x2013;26</a>. What did King Benjamin teach that inspires you to serve others in a more meaningful way? For example, what does it mean to you to know that when you serve other people, you are also serving God? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17">Mosiah 2:17</a>). Seek inspiration about how you can serve someone this week.</p>
<p data-aid="154069194" id="p4">Even when we know we should serve others, we sometimes face challenges. Another way to study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p10-p26#p10">Mosiah 2:10&#x2013;26</a> is to make a list of truths King Benjamin taught that can help you overcome the challenges that might keep you from serving. What experiences have shown you that what King Benjamin taught is true?</p>
<p data-aid="154069200" id="p5">President Joy&#xA0;D. Jones shared a powerful experience that changed the way she looked at serving others. Read about it in &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2018/10/for-him?lang=eng">For Him</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2018, 50&#x2013;52), and think about the opportunities you have to serve others. You might even list a few and ponder how President Jones&#x2019;s message, along with <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17">Mosiah 2:17</a>, might influence the way you approach these opportunities. A hymn such as &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/a-poor-wayfaring-man-of-grief?lang=eng">A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;29) or a video like &#x201C;The Old Shoemaker&#x201D; (Gospel Library) might help you think of additional insights.</p>

<p data-aid="154069148" id="p1">Although Enos went to the forest to hunt beasts to satisfy physical hunger, he ended up staying there all day and into the night because his &#x201C;soul hungered.&#x201D; This hunger led Enos to &#x201C;raise [his] voice high that it reached the heavens.&#x201D; He described this experience as a wrestle before God (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p2-p4#p2">Enos 1:2&#x2013;4</a>). From Enos we learn that prayer is a sincere effort to draw near to God and seek to know His will. When you pray with this intent, you are more likely to discover, as Enos did, that God hears you and truly cares about you, your loved ones, and even your enemies (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p4-p17#p4">Enos 1:4&#x2013;17</a>). When you know His will, you are better able to do His will. Like Mormon, you may &#x201C;not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;; wherefore, he worketh in [you] to do according to his will&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7">Words of Mormon 1:7</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154069296" id="p16">One reason the Lord inspired Mormon to include the small plates of Nephi in the Book of Mormon was because He knew that the first 116 translated pages would be lost (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng">Doctrine and Covenants&#xA0;10</a>; <cite>Saints</cite>, <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/history/saints-v1/05-all-is-lost?lang=eng">volume&#xA0;1, chapter&#xA0;5</a>). Why are you grateful that Mormon followed the Lord&#x2019;s instruction to include these writings (consisting of 1&#xA0;Nephi through Omni)? What reasons did Mormon give for including them? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p3-p7#p3">Words of Mormon 1:3&#x2013;7</a>). When have you seen God working through you or others?</p>

<p data-aid="154069167" id="p1">Have you ever heard someone speak and felt inspired to change your life? Perhaps you decided, because of what you heard, to live a little differently&#x2014;or even a lot differently. King Benjamin&#x2019;s sermon was that kind of sermon, and the truths he taught had that kind of effect on the people who heard them. King Benjamin shared with his people what an angel had taught him&#x2014;that wonderful blessings were possible through &#x201C;the atoning blood of Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 4:2</a>). Because of His message, they changed their view of themselves (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 4:2</a>), the Spirit changed their desires (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 5:2</a>), and they covenanted with God that they would always do His will (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Mosiah 5:5</a>). This is how King Benjamin&#x2019;s words affected his people. How will they affect you?</p>

<p data-aid="154069190" id="p2">Sometimes, even when you have felt forgiven of your sins, you might struggle to keep that feeling and stay on the path of righteousness. King Benjamin taught his people how to both receive and retain a remission of sins. As you study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng">chapter&#xA0;4</a> of Mosiah, consider asking questions like these:</p>

<p data-aid="154069257" id="p11">King Benjamin&#x2019;s invitation to believe in and trust God is as important today as it was in ancient times. As you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p10#p5">Mosiah 4:5&#x2013;10</a>, look for truths about God that give you reason to trust Him.

<p data-aid="154069327" id="p16">It&#x2019;s common for people to say, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t change. That&#x2019;s just the way I am.&#x201D; In contrast, the experience of King Benjamin&#x2019;s people shows us how the Spirit of the Lord can truly change our hearts. As you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p5#p1">Mosiah 5:1&#x2013;5</a>, think about how the &#x201C;mighty change&#x201D; leading to true conversion has happened&#x2014;or can happen&#x2014;in your life.
