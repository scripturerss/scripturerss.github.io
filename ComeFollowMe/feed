            <li id="jacob_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you that I would prophesy, behold, this is my prophecy&#x2014;that the things which this prophet Zenos spake, concerning the house of Israel, in the which he likened them unto a tame olive tree, must surely come to pass.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time to recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish and prune his vineyard; and after that the end soon cometh.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And how blessed are they who have labored diligently in his vineyard; and how cursed are they who shall be cast out into their own place!  And the world shall be burned with fire.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the house of Israel, both roots and branches; and he stretches forth his hands unto them all the day long; and they are a stiffnecked and a gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their hearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of soberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of heart, and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you.  And while his arm of mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day, harden not your hearts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; for why will ye die?</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For behold, after ye have been nourished by the good word of God all the day long, will ye bring forth evil fruit, that ye must be hewn down and cast into the fire?</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, will ye reject these words?  Will ye reject the words of the prophets; and will ye reject all the words which have been spoken concerning Christ, after so many have spoken concerning him; and deny the good word of Christ, and the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit, and make a mock of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid for you?</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Know ye not that if ye will do these things, that the power of the redemption and the resurrection, which is in Christ, will bring you to stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God?</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And according to the power of justice, for justice cannot be denied, ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is endless torment.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> O then, my beloved brethren, repent ye, and enter in at the strait gate, and continue in the way which is narrow, until ye shall obtain eternal life.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> O be wise; what can I say more?</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Finally, I bid you farewell, until I shall meet you before the pleasing bar of God, which bar striketh the wicked with awful dread and fear.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> The words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi, spake unto the people of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, and that I might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you the word of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been diligent in the office of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with much more desire and anxiety for the welfare of your souls than I have hitherto been.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the Lord, which I have given unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth I can tell you concerning your thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in sin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and abominable unto God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame before the presence of my Maker, that I must testify unto you concerning the wickedness of your hearts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And also it grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech concerning you, before your wives and your children, many of whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate before God, which thing is pleasing unto God;</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the pleasing word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded soul.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained, because of the strict commandment which I have received from God, to admonish you according to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds of those who are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing their wounds; and those who have not been wounded, instead of feasting upon the pleasing word of God have daggers placed to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do according to the strict commands of God, and tell you concerning your wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in heart, and the broken heart, and under the glance of the piercing eye of the Almighty God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the plainness of the word of God.  For behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying: Jacob, get thou up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall give thee unto this people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare unto you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for silver, and for all manner of precious ores, in the which this land, which is a land of promise unto you and to your seed, doth abound most plentifully.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly, that you have obtained many riches; and because some of you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better than they.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, my brethren, do ye suppose that God justifieth you in this thing?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay.  But he condemneth you, and if ye persist in these things his judgments must speedily come unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> O that he would show you that he can pierce you, and with one glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust!</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> O that he would rid you from this iniquity and abomination.  And, O that ye would listen unto the word of his commands, and let not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls!</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good&#x2014;to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you concerning pride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him because ye were proud in your hearts, of the things which God hath given you, what say ye of it?</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him who created all flesh?  And the one being is as precious in his sight as the other.  And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments and glorify him forever.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this pride.  And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a grosser crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly because of you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes.  For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women.  And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out of the land of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms, like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments were given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them before; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things which ye ought not to have done.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren.  Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you.  And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart.  Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down justice upon those who seek your destruction.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy this day before God; for except ye repent the land is cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you, nevertheless they are cursed with a sore cursing, shall scourge you even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead away the righteous out from among you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father&#x2014;that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may not become angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second death.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi, warning them against fornication and lasciviousness, and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which now began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these plates; but many of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates, and their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by the hand of Nephi.  And I make an end of speaking these words.</li>

            <li id="jacob_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words of the prophet Zenos, which he spake unto the house of Israel, saying:</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the words of me, a prophet of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O house of Israel, like unto a tame olive tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive tree began to decay; and he said: I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish not.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it, and nourished it according to his word.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that after many days it began to put forth somewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the main top thereof began to perish.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it, and he said unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild olive tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off those...</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Take thou the branches of the wild olive tree, and graft them in, in the stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off I will cast into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber the ground of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the vineyard did according to the word of the Lord of the vineyard, and grafted in the branches of the wild olive tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and nourish it, according to my words.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And these will I place in the nethermost part of my vineyard, whithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; and I do it that I may preserve unto myself the natural branches of the tree; and also, that I may lay up fruit thereof against the season, unto myself; for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree and the fruit thereof.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went his way, and hid the natural branches of the tame olive tree in the nethermost parts of the vineyard, some in one and some in another, according to his will and pleasure.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that a long time passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor in the vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and also the servant, went down into the vineyard to labor.  And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Behold, look here; behold the tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and beheld the tree in the which the wild olive branches had been grafted; and it had sprung forth and begun to bear fruit.  And he beheld that it was good; and the fruit thereof was like unto the natural fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And he said unto the servant: Behold, the branches of the wild tree have taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof, that the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and because of the much strength of the root thereof the wild branches have brought forth tame fruit.  Now, if we had not grafted in these branches, the tree thereof would have perished.  And now, behold, I shall lay up much fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought forth; and the fruit thereof I shall lay up against the season, unto mine own self.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Come, let us go to the nethermost part of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches of the tree have not brought forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of the fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that they went forth whither the master had hid the natural branches of the tree, and he said unto the servant: Behold these; and he beheld the first that it had brought forth much fruit; and he beheld also that it was good.  And he said unto the servant: Take of the fruit thereof, and lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self; for behold, said he, this long time have I nourished it, and it hath brought forth much fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: How comest thou hither to plant this tree, or this branch of the tree?  For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him: Counsel me not; I knew that it was a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, I have nourished it this long time, and thou beholdest that it hath brought forth much fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Look hither; behold I have planted another branch of the tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer than the first.  But, behold the tree.  I have nourished it this long time, and it hath brought forth much fruit; therefore, gather it, and lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said again unto his servant: Look hither, and behold another branch also, which I have planted; behold that I have nourished it also, and it hath brought forth fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the last.  Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck off the branches that have not brought forth good fruit, and cast them into the fire.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, the servant said unto him: Let us prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little longer, that perhaps it may bring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up against the season.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant of the Lord of the vineyard did nourish all the fruit of the vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that a long time had passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard.  For behold, the time draweth near, and the end soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own self.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant went down into the vineyard; and they came to the tree whose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches had been grafted in; and behold all sorts of fruit did cumber the tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard did taste of the fruit, every sort according to its number.  And the Lord of the vineyard said: Behold, this long time have we nourished this tree, and I have laid up unto myself against the season much fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But behold, this time it hath brought forth much fruit, and there is none of it which is good.  And behold, there are all kinds of bad fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding all our labor; and now it grieveth me that I should lose this tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: What shall we do unto the tree, that I may preserve again good fruit thereof unto mine own self?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And the servant said unto his master: Behold, because thou didst graft in the branches of the wild olive tree they have nourished the roots, that they are alive and they have not perished; wherefore thou beholdest that they are yet good.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: The tree profiteth me nothing, and the roots thereof profit me nothing so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good, and for mine own purpose I have preserved them; and because of their much strength they have hitherto brought forth, from the wild branches, good fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But behold, the wild branches have grown and have overrun the roots thereof; and because that the wild branches have overcome the roots thereof it hath brought forth much evil fruit; and because that it hath brought forth so much evil fruit thou beholdest that it beginneth to perish; and it will soon become ripened, that it may be cast into the fire, except we should do something for it to preserve it.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches have also brought forth evil fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And it came to pass that they went down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard.  And it came to pass that they beheld that the fruit of the natural branches had become corrupt also; yea, the first and the second and also the last; and they had all become corrupt.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And the wild fruit of the last had overcome that part of the tree which brought forth good fruit, even that the branch had withered away and died.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and said unto the servant: What could I have done more for my vineyard?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it were these, had become corrupted.  And now these which have once brought forth good fruit have also become corrupted; and now all the trees of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to be hewn down and cast into the fire.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And behold this last, whose branch hath withered away, I did plant in a good spot of ground; yea, even that which was choice unto me above all other parts of the land of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> And thou beheldest that I also cut down that which cumbered this spot of ground, that I might plant this tree in the stead thereof.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And thou beheldest that a part thereof brought forth good fruit, and a part thereof brought forth wild fruit; and because I plucked not the branches thereof and cast them into the fire, behold, they have overcome the good branch that it hath withered away.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And now, behold, notwithstanding all the care which we have taken of my vineyard, the trees thereof have become corrupted, that they bring forth no good fruit; and these I had hoped to preserve, to have laid up fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self.  But, behold, they have become like unto the wild olive tree, and they are of no worth but to be hewn down and cast into the fire; and it grieveth me that I should lose them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> But what could I have done more in my vineyard?  Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it?  Nay, I have nourished it, and I have digged about it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost all the day long, and the end draweth nigh.  And it grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire that they should be burned.  Who is it that has corrupted my vineyard?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Is it not the loftiness of thy vineyard&#x2014;have not the branches thereof overcome the roots which are good?  And because the branches have overcome the roots thereof, behold they grew faster than the strength of the roots, taking strength unto themselves.  Behold, I say, is not this the cause that the trees of thy vineyard have become corrupted?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Let us go to and hew down the trees of the vineyard and cast them into the fire, that they shall not cumber the ground of my vineyard, for I have done all.  What could I have done more for my vineyard?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> But, behold, the servant said unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare it a little longer.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And the Lord said: Yea, I will spare it a little longer, for it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> Wherefore, let us take of the branches of these which I have planted in the nethermost parts of my vineyard, and let us graft them into the tree from whence they came; and let us pluck from the tree those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in the natural branches of the tree in the stead thereof.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> And this will I do that the tree may not perish, that, perhaps, I may preserve unto myself the roots thereof for mine own purpose.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> And, behold, the roots of the natural branches of the tree which I planted whithersoever I would are yet alive; wherefore, that I may preserve them also for mine own purpose, I will take of the branches of this tree, and I will graft them in unto them. Yea, I will graft in unto them the branches of their mother tree, that I may preserve the roots also unto mine own self, that when they shall be sufficiently strong perhaps they may bring forth good fruit unto me, and I may yet have glory in the fruit of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.55" class=""><span class="verse">55</span> And it came to pass that they took from the natural tree which had become wild, and grafted in unto the natural trees, which also had become wild.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.56" class=""><span class="verse">56</span> And they also took of the natural trees which had become wild, and grafted into their mother tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.57" class=""><span class="verse">57</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck not the wild branches from the trees, save it be those which are most bitter; and in them ye shall graft according to that which I have said.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.58" class=""><span class="verse">58</span> And we will nourish again the trees of the vineyard, and we will trim up the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the trees those branches which are ripened, that must perish, and cast them into the fire.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.59" class=""><span class="verse">59</span> And this I do that, perhaps, the roots thereof may take strength because of their goodness; and because of the change of the branches, that the good may overcome the evil.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.60" class=""><span class="verse">60</span> And because that I have preserved the natural branches and the roots thereof, and that I have grafted in the natural branches again into their mother tree, and have preserved the roots of their mother tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my vineyard may bring forth again good fruit; and that I may have joy again in the fruit of my vineyard, and, perhaps, that I may rejoice exceedingly that I have preserved the roots and the branches of the first fruit&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.61" class=""><span class="verse">61</span> Wherefore, go to, and call servants, that we may labor diligently with our might in the vineyard, that we may prepare the way, that I may bring forth again the natural fruit, which natural fruit is good and the most precious above all other fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.62" class=""><span class="verse">62</span> Wherefore, let us go to and labor with our might this last time, for behold the end draweth nigh, and this is for the last time that I shall prune my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.63" class=""><span class="verse">63</span> Graft in the branches; begin at the last that they may be first, and that the first may be last, and dig about the trees, both old and young, the first and the last; and the last and the first, that all may be nourished once again for the last time.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.64" class=""><span class="verse">64</span> Wherefore, dig about them, and prune them, and dung them once more, for the last time, for the end draweth nigh.  And if it be so that these last grafts shall grow, and bring forth the natural fruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that they may grow.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.65" class=""><span class="verse">65</span> And as they begin to grow ye shall clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the good and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad thereof all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.66" class=""><span class="verse">66</span> For it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard; wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the good shall grow, that the root and the top may be equal in strength, until the good shall overcome the bad, and the bad be hewn down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not the ground of my vineyard; and thus will I sweep away the bad out of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.67" class=""><span class="verse">67</span> And the branches of the natural tree will I graft in again into the natural tree;</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.68" class=""><span class="verse">68</span> And the branches of the natural tree will I graft into the natural branches of the tree; and thus will I bring them together again, that they shall bring forth the natural fruit, and they shall be one.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.69" class=""><span class="verse">69</span> And the bad shall be cast away, yea, even out of all the land of my vineyard; for behold, only this once will I prune my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.70" class=""><span class="verse">70</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other servants; and they were few.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.71" class=""><span class="verse">71</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might.  For behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.72" class=""><span class="verse">72</span> And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.73" class=""><span class="verse">73</span> And there began to be the natural fruit again in the vineyard; and the natural branches began to grow and thrive exceedingly; and the wild branches began to be plucked off and to be cast away; and they did keep the root and the top thereof equal, according to the strength thereof.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.74" class=""><span class="verse">74</span> And thus they labored, with all diligence, according to the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard, even until the bad had been cast away out of the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved unto himself that the trees had become again the natural fruit; and they became like unto one body; and the fruits were equal; and the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto himself the natural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the beginning.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.75" class=""><span class="verse">75</span> And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more corrupt, he called up his servants, and said unto them: Behold, for this last time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have preserved the natural fruit, that it is good, even like as it was in the beginning.  And blessed art thou; for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and have brought unto me again the natural fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away, behold ye shall have joy with me because of the fruit of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.76" class=""><span class="verse">76</span> For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard unto mine own self against the season, which speedily cometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I will lay up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to that which I have spoken.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.77" class=""><span class="verse">77</span> And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my vineyard, then will I cause the good and the bad to be gathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast away into its own place.  And then cometh the season and the end; and my vineyard will I cause to be burned with fire.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered much unto my people in word, (and I cannot write but a little of my words, because of the difficulty of engraving our words upon plates) and we know that the things which we write upon plates must remain;</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon plates must perish and vanish away; but we can write a few words upon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved brethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or concerning their fathers&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first parents.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his name. And for this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do these things.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord.  How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways.  And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word.  Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand.  For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through the atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things; for why not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the understanding of men; for the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not.  Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls.  But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also spake them unto prophets of old.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they despised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and sought for things that they could not understand.  Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall; for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things which they cannot understand, because they desired it.  And because they desired it God hath done it, that they may stumble.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying; for I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that by the stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they might build and have safe foundation.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But behold, according to the scriptures, this stone shall become the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon which the Jews can build.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that it may become the head of their corner?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this mystery unto you; if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass after some years had passed away, there came a man among the people of Nephi, whose name was Sherem.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people, and to declare unto them that there should be no Christ.  And he preached many things which were flattering unto the people; and this he did that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts of the people, insomuch that he did lead away many hearts; and he knowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he sought much opportunity that he might come unto me.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he was learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he could use much flattery, and much power of speech, according to the power of the devil.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many revelations and the many things which I had seen concerning these things; for I truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto me.  And also, I had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the right way of God, and keep not the law of Moses which is the right way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence.  And now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is blasphemy; for no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot tell of things to come.  And after this manner did Sherem contend against me.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, the Lord God poured in his Spirit into my soul, insomuch that I did confound him in all his words.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And I said unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who shall come? And he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever will be.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures?  And he said, Yea.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they truly testify of Christ.  Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And this is not all&#x2014;it has been made manifest unto me, for I have heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should be no atonement made all mankind must be lost.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he said unto me: Show me a sign by this power of the Holy Ghost, in the which ye know so much.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And I said unto him: What am I that I should tempt God to show unto thee a sign in the thing which thou knowest to be true? Yet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the devil.  Nevertheless, not my will be done; but if God shall smite thee, let that be a sign unto thee that he has power, both in heaven and in earth; and also, that Christ shall come.  And thy will, O Lord, be done, and not mine.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that when I, Jacob, had spoken these words, the power of the Lord came upon him, insomuch that he fell to the earth.  And it came to pass that he was nourished for the space of many days.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that he said unto the people: Gather together on the morrow, for I shall die; wherefore, I desire to speak unto the people before I shall die.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were gathered together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied the things which he had taught them, and confessed the Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And he spake plainly unto them, that he had been deceived by the power of the devil.  And he spake of hell, and of eternity, and of eternal punishment.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And he said: I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him.  And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case shall be awful; but I confess unto God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that when he had said these words he could say no more, and he gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And when the multitude had witnessed that he spake these things as he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished exceedingly; insomuch that the power of God came down upon them, and they were overcome that they fell to the earth.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob, for I had requested it of my Father who was in heaven; for he had heard my cry and answered my prayer.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that peace and the love of God was restored again among the people; and they searched the scriptures, and hearkened no more to the words of this wicked man.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that many means were devised to reclaim and restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it all was vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an eternal hatred against us, their brethren.  And they sought by the power of their arms to destroy us continually.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against them with their arms, and with all their might, trusting in the God and rock of their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet, conquerors of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the other plates of Nephi, wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave; wherefore, I said unto my son Enos: Take these plates.  And I told him the things which my brother Nephi had commanded me, and he promised obedience unto the commands.  And I make an end of my writing upon these plates, which writing has been small; and to the reader I bid farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may read my words.  Brethren, adieu.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="nano-content">
        <div class="chapterheading">The Book of Enos</div>
        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="enos_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man&#x2014;for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord&#x2014;and blessed be the name of my God for it&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="enos_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before I received a remission of my sins.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And I said: Lord, how is it done?</li>
            <li id="enos_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen.  And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments.  I have given unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said; and their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him&#x2014;that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall into transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites should not be destroyed, that the Lord God would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be brought forth at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be brought unto salvation&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="enos_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring them to the true faith.  And they swore in their wrath that, if it were possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also all the traditions of our fathers.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to preserve our records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto me: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would preserve the records; and he covenanted with me that he would bring them forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And I, Enos, knew it would be according to the covenant which he had made; wherefore my soul did rest.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto thine.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went about among the people of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of the things which I had heard and seen.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God.  But our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax.  And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild goats, and also many horses.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there were exceedingly many prophets among us.  And the people were a stiffnecked people, hard to understand.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And there was nothing save it was exceeding harshness, preaching and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and continually reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and all these things&#x2014;stirring them up continually to keep them in the fear of the Lord.  I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to destruction.  And after this manner do I write concerning them.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And I saw wars between the Nephites and Lamanites in the course of my days.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that I began to be old, and an hundred and seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our father Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been wrought upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy unto this people, and declare the word according to the truth which is in Christ.  And I have declared it in all my days, and have rejoiced in it above that of the world.</li>
            <li id="enos_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest.  And I rejoice in the day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father.  Amen.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="nano-content">
        <div class="chapterheading">The Book of Jarom</div>
        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jarom_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words according to the commandment of my father, Enos, that our genealogy may be kept.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And as these plates are small, and as these things are written for the intent of the benefit of our brethren the Lamanites, wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall not write the things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations.  For what could I write more than my fathers have written?  For have not they revealed the plan of salvation?  I say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the stiffness of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly merciful unto them, and has not as yet swept them off from the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And there are many among us who have many revelations, for they are not all stiffnecked.  And as many as are not stiffnecked and have faith, have communion with the Holy Spirit, which maketh manifest unto the children of men, according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in the land.  They observed to keep the law of Moses and the sabbath day holy unto the Lord.  And they profaned not; neither did they blaspheme.  And the laws of the land were exceedingly strict.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and the Lamanites also.  And they were exceedingly more numerous than were they of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink the blood of beasts.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the Nephites, to battle.  But our kings and our leaders were mighty men in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways of the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them away out of our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever place of our inheritance.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the land, and became exceedingly rich in gold, and in silver, and in precious things, and in fine workmanship of wood, in buildings, and in machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and steel, making all manner of tools of every kind to till the ground, and weapons of war&#x2014;yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for war.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not prosper against us.  But the word of the Lord was verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did threaten the people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that if they did not keep the commandments, but should fall into transgression, they should be destroyed from off the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers, did labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the people to diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent for which it was given; persuading them to look forward unto the Messiah, and believe in him to come as though he already was.  And after this manner did they teach them.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from being destroyed upon the face of the land; for they did prick their hearts with the word, continually stirring them up unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that two hundred and thirty and eight years had passed away&#x2014;after the manner of wars, and contentions, and dissensions, for the space of much of the time.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small.  But behold, my brethren, ye can go to the other plates of Nephi; for behold, upon them the records of our wars are engraven, according to the writings of the kings, or those which they caused to be written.</li>
            <li id="jarom_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And I deliver these plates into the hands of my son Omni, that they may be kept according to the commandments of my fathers.</li>

            <li id="omni_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, it came to pass that I, Omni, being commanded by my father, Jarom, that I should write somewhat upon these plates, to preserve our genealogy&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="omni_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should know that I fought much with the sword to preserve my people, the Nephites, from falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites.  But behold, I of myself am a wicked man, and I have not kept the statutes and the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have done.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that two hundred and seventy and six years had passed away, and we had many seasons of peace; and we had many seasons of serious war and bloodshed.  Yea, and in fine, two hundred and eighty and two years had passed away, and I had kept these plates according to the commandments of my fathers; and I conferred them upon my son Amaron.  And I make an end.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now I, Amaron, write the things whatsoever I write, which are few, in the book of my father.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, it came to pass that three hundred and twenty years had passed away, and the more wicked part of the Nephites were destroyed.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For the Lord would not suffer, after he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from falling into the hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suffer that the words should not be verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall not prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great judgment; nevertheless, he did spare the righteous that they should not perish, but did deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my brother Chemish.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same book with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which he wrote, that he wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day that he delivered them unto me.  And after this manner we keep the records, for it is according to the commandments of our fathers.  And I make an end.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I, Abinadom, am the son of Chemish.  Behold, it came to pass that I saw much war and contention between my people, the Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword, have taken the lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my brethren.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, the record of this people is engraven upon plates which is had by the kings, according to the generations; and I know of no revelation save that which has been written, neither prophecy; wherefore, that which is sufficient is written. And I make an end.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom.  Behold, I will speak unto you somewhat concerning Mosiah, who was made king over the land of Zarahemla; for behold, he being warned of the Lord that he should flee out of the land of Nephi, and as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord should also depart out of the land with him, into the wilderness&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="omni_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he did according as the Lord had commanded him.  And they departed out of the land into the wilderness, as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord; and they were led by many preachings and prophesyings.  And they were admonished continually by the word of God; and they were led by the power of his arm, through the wilderness until they came down into the land which is called the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they discovered a people, who were called the people of Zarahemla.  Now, there was great rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla; and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the plates of brass which contained the record of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah discovered that the people of Zarahemla came out from Jerusalem at the time that Zedekiah, king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And they journeyed in the wilderness, and were brought by the hand of the Lord across the great waters, into the land where Mosiah discovered them; and they had dwelt there from that time forth.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, they had become exceedingly numerous.  Nevertheless, they had had many wars and serious contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to time; and their language had become corrupted; and they had brought no records with them; and they denied the being of their Creator; and Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could understand them.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be taught in his language.  And it came to pass that after they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers, according to his memory; and they are written, but not in these plates.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah, did unite together; and Mosiah was appointed to be their king.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah, there was a large stone brought unto him with engravings on it; and he did interpret the engravings by the gift and power of God.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of his people.  And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla; and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> It also spake a few words concerning his fathers.  And his first parents came out from the tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people; and the severity of the Lord fell upon them according to his judgments, which are just; and their bones lay scattered in the land northward.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I have lived to see his death; and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in his stead.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And behold, I have seen, in the days of king Benjamin, a serious war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the Lamanites.  But behold, the Nephites did obtain much advantage over them; yea, insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no seed, and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord, wherefore, I shall deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting all men to come unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in prophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of angels, and in the gift of speaking with tongues, and in the gift of interpreting languages, and in all things which are good; for there is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord; and that which is evil cometh from the devil.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption.  Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now I would speak somewhat concerning a certain number who went up into the wilderness to return to the land of Nephi; for there was a large number who were desirous to possess the land of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Wherefore, they went up into the wilderness.  And their leader being a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man, wherefore he caused a contention among them; and they were all slain, save fifty, in the wilderness, and they returned again to the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that they also took others to a considerable number, and took their journey again into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="omni_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And I, Amaleki, had a brother, who also went with them; and I have not since known concerning them.  And I am about to lie down in my grave; and these plates are full.  And I make an end of my speaking.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="w of m_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which I have been making into the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have witnessed almost all the destruction of my people, the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I deliver these records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth me that he will witness the entire destruction of my people.  But may God grant that he may survive them, that he may write somewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may profit them.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after I had made an abridgment from the plates of Nephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into my hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small account of the prophets, from Jacob down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me, because of the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my fathers knowing that many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as many things as have been prophesied concerning us down to this day have been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond this day must surely come to pass&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon them, which remainder of my record I shall take from the plates of Nephi; and I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of my people.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, I shall take these plates, which contain these prophesyings and revelations, and put them with the remainder of my record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be choice unto my brethren.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me.  And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may once again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of Christ; that they may once again be a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my record, which I take from the plates of Nephi; and I make it according to the knowledge and the understanding which God has given me.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki had delivered up these plates into the hands of king Benjamin, he took them and put them with the other plates, which contained records which had been handed down by the kings, from generation to generation until the days of king Benjamin.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to generation until they have fallen into my hands.  And I, Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved from this time henceforth.  And I know that they will be preserved; for there are great things written upon them, out of which my people and their brethren shall be judged at the great and last day, according to the word of God which is written.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, concerning this king Benjamin&#x2014;he had somewhat of contentions among his own people.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites came down out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his people.  But behold, king Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he did stand against them; and he did fight with the strength of his own arm, with the sword of Laban.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And in the strength of the Lord they did contend against their enemies, until they had slain many thousands of the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that they did contend against the Lamanites until they had driven them out of all the lands of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that after there had been false Christs, and their mouths had been shut, and they punished according to their crimes;</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after there had been false prophets, and false preachers and teachers among the people, and all these having been punished according to their crimes; and after there having been much contention and many dissensions away unto the Lamanites, behold, it came to pass that king Benjamin, with the assistance of the holy prophets who were among his people&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and he did reign over his people in righteousness; and there were many holy men in the land, and they did speak the word of God with power and with authority; and they did use much sharpness because of the stiffneckedness of the people&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="w of m_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, with the help of these, king Benjamin, by laboring with all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul, and also the prophets, did once more establish peace in the land.</li>

        <div class="chapterheading">The Book of Mosiah</div>
        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman.  And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true.  And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of teaching his sons, that he waxed old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this people, whom the Lord our God hath given us.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out, except it be through transgression.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored people of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become weak like unto their brethren; and he will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of these sayings to his son, that he gave him charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the plates of Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor progress in their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his father had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the people who were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather themselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words which his father should speak unto them.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> For behold, it came to pass that fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates, upon which these things are engraven.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation which was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the heads of them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for Christ&#x2019;s sake, and for the sake of our people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people, what things should happen unto them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ and his kingdom, which should come.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to come unto Christ, and partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die; wherefore, he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now, according to the reigns of the kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> The people having loved Nephi exceedingly, he having been a great protector for them, having wielded the sword of Laban in their defence, and having labored in all his days for their welfare&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name.  And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name they would.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that Nephi died.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solomon, his son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, and they also began to search much gold and silver, and began to be lifted up somewhat in pride.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the Lord.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated priests and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the land, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And there were a great number, even so many that they did not number them; for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they also took of the firstlings of their flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the law of Moses;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had appointed just men to be their teachers, and also a just man to be their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the commandments of God, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For the multitude being so great that king Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of the temple, therefore he caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that he began to speak to his people from the tower; and they could not all hear his words because of the greatness of the multitude; therefore he caused that the words which he spake should be written and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also receive his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And these are the words which he spake and caused to be written, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne&#x2014;and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might boast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can answer a clear conscience before God this day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to serve one another?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king, who has spent his days in your service, and yet has been in the service of God, do merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your heavenly King!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another&#x2014;I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you.  And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves?  I answer you, Nay.  Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust.  And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done.  As ye have kept my commandments, and also the commandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are; and also have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom&#x2019;s paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.  For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.  O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</li>

<p data-aid="154069148" id="p1">Although Enos went to the forest to hunt beasts to satisfy physical hunger, he ended up staying there all day and into the night because his &#x201C;soul hungered.&#x201D; This hunger led Enos to &#x201C;raise [his] voice high that it reached the heavens.&#x201D; He described this experience as a wrestle before God (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.2-4?lang=eng#p2">Enos 1:2&#x2013;4</a>). From Enos we learn that prayer is a sincere effort to draw near to God and seek to know His will. When you pray with this intent, you are more likely to discover, as Enos did, that God hears you and truly cares about you, your loved ones, and even your enemies (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.4-17?lang=eng#p4">Enos 1:4&#x2013;17</a>). When you know His will, you are better able to do His will. Like Mormon, you may &#x201C;not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;; wherefore, he worketh in [you] to do according to his will&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1.7?lang=eng#p7">Words of Mormon 1:7</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154069296" id="p16">One reason the Lord inspired Mormon to include the small plates of Nephi in the Book of Mormon was because He knew that the first 116 translated pages would be lost (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng">Doctrine and Covenants&#xA0;10</a>; <cite>Saints</cite>, <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/history/saints-v1/05-all-is-lost?lang=eng">volume&#xA0;1, chapter&#xA0;5</a>). Why are you grateful that Mormon followed the Lord&#x2019;s instruction to include these writings (consisting of 1&#xA0;Nephi through Omni)? What reasons did Mormon give for including them?

He would point them to Jesus Christ&#x2014;because both groups needed the Savior&#x2019;s healing (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;4</a>). Like the message of Nephi before him, Jacob&#x2019;s testimony was a call to &#x201C;be reconciled unto [God] through the atonement of Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.11?lang=eng#p11">Jacob 4:11</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154070512" id="p1">There are many, many people who haven&#x2019;t yet heard the gospel of Jesus Christ. If you ever feel overwhelmed by the immensity of the task of gathering them into the Lord&#x2019;s Church, what Jacob said about olive trees in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a> has a reassuring reminder: the vineyard belongs to the Lord. He has given each of us a small area to assist in His work&#x2014;our family, our circle of friends, our sphere of influence. And sometimes the first person we help gather is ourselves. But we are never alone in this work, for the Lord of the vineyard labors alongside His servants (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.72?lang=eng#p72">Jacob 5:72</a>). God knows and loves His children, and He will prepare a way for each of them to hear His gospel, even those who have rejected Him in the past (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.15-18?lang=eng#p15">Jacob 4:15&#x2013;18</a>). And then, when the work is done, all those who have been &#x201C;diligent in laboring with [Him] &#x2026; shall have joy with [Him] because of the fruit of [His] vineyard&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.75?lang=eng#p75">Jacob 5:75</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154070562" id="p2"><a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a> is a story with symbolic meaning. It describes trees and fruit and laborers, but it&#x2019;s really about God&#x2019;s interactions with His people throughout history. So as you read the basic story, think about what some of the things in the story might symbolize.</p>
<p data-aid="154070576" id="p3">For example, if the vineyard represents the world, and the tame olive tree represents Israel (or those who have made covenants with God; see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.3?lang=eng#p3">Jacob 5:3</a>), what might the wild olive trees represent? What could the good and bad fruit represent? What other symbols do you see?</p>
<p data-aid="154070590" id="p4">Even though <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a> teaches about nations and centuries of world history, it&#x2019;s also about you and your life. What messages do you find for yourself in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a>?</p>
<p data-aid="154070603" id="p5">Perhaps most important, <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;5</a> is about Jesus Christ. Look for Him as you read. What do you learn about Him, for example, in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.40-41,46-47?lang=eng">verses 40&#x2013;41, 46&#x2013;47</a>?</p>

(<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.71?lang=eng#p71">Jacob 5:71</a>). Maybe you could think of a personal experience in which you felt joy while serving the Lord of the vineyard&#x2014;for example, through sharing the gospel, serving in the temple, or strengthening others. You might also explore the examples Elder Gary&#xA0;E. Stevenson shared in his message &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2021/10/29stevenson?lang=eng">Simply Beautiful&#x2014;Beautifully Simple</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2021, 47&#x2013;50).</p>

Consider starting a list of ideas of what you can do to help gather Israel. From your list, what do you feel the Lord would have you do today in His vineyard? According to <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.75?lang=eng#p75">verse&#xA0;75</a>, how does the Lord reward us for service in His vineyard?</p>

<p data-aid="154070834" id="p15">How can you share the story of the olive trees in a way that your children can understand? One way is to take a walk outside to look at a tree and briefly review the main points of the story. What did the Lord of the vineyard do for His trees? How can we be like workers in the story and help others feel the Savior&#x2019;s love?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070842" id="p16">Jacob shared the story of the olive trees to invite his people to come unto Christ. It can do the same for your children. Perhaps you could summarize the story with verses such as <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.3-4,28-29,47,70-72?lang=eng#p3">Jacob 5:3&#x2013;4, 28&#x2013;29, 47, and 70&#x2013;72</a> (see also &#x201C;Old Testament Olive Vineyard&#x201D; [video], Gospel Library). You or your children could then read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.11,41,47,72?lang=eng#p11">Jacob 5:11, 41, 47, and&#xA0;72</a>, looking for things that show how much the Lord of the vineyard (Jesus Christ) cared about the trees. What does the Savior do to show that He cares about us?</p>

<div class="body-block">
<p data-aid="154070471" id="p1">The ancient Apostles were bold in their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His Resurrection (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/acts/4.33?lang=eng#p33">Acts 4:33</a>). Millions of people believe in Jesus Christ and try to follow Him because of their words recorded in the Bible. Yet some people might wonder: If Jesus Christ is the Savior of the whole world, then why were His eyewitnesses limited to a handful of people in one small region?</p>
<p data-aid="154070484" id="p2">The Book of Mormon stands as an additional, convincing witness that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, &#x201C;manifesting himself unto all nations&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng">title page of the Book of Mormon</a>) and offering salvation to all who come unto Him. In addition, this second witness also makes it clear what salvation means. This is why Nephi, Jacob, Mormon, and all the prophets labored so &#x201C;diligently to engraven these words upon plates&#x201D;&#x2014;to declare to future generations that they too &#x201C;knew of Christ, and &#x2026; had a hope of his glory&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.3-4?lang=eng#p3">Jacob 4:3&#x2013;4</a>). This Easter season, reflect on the testimonies in the Book of Mormon that the Savior&#x2019;s power is both universal and personal&#x2014;redeeming the whole world and redeeming you.</p>

<p data-aid="154070521" id="p3">It&#x2019;s traditional at Easter to ponder the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, but what exactly does it mean to be resurrected? What insights does the Book of Mormon offer about resurrection? Perhaps this Easter season you could list truths about resurrection that you find in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.6-15,22?lang=eng#p6">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:6&#x2013;15,&#xA0;22</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.42-45?lang=eng#p42">Alma 11:42&#x2013;45</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.21-25?lang=eng#p21">40:21&#x2013;25</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.4-5?lang=eng#p4">3&#xA0;Nephi 26:4&#x2013;5</a>.</p>
<p data-aid="154070533" id="p4">You could also record how these truths about resurrection influence your actions and the way you live. For example, consider how you would complete these sentences: <i>If I did not know these things&#xA0;&#x2026;</i> and <i>Because I know these things&#xA0;&#x2026;</i></p>
<p data-aid="154070547" id="p5">A hymn like &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/i-know-that-my-redeemer-lives?lang=eng">I Know That My Redeemer Lives</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;136) could help you think about why the Savior&#x2019;s Resurrection is important to you. As you sing, listen to, or read the hymn, you might ask yourself, &#x201C;How is my life different because Jesus Christ was resurrected?&#x201D;</p>
<p data-aid="154070561" id="p6">The Gospel Library has a collection of <a href="/study/video/easter-videos?lang=eng">Easter videos</a> that could be a meaningful part of your study. Perhaps you could watch one or more of these videos and ponder what they add to your understanding or appreciation of the Savior&#x2019;s Resurrection.</p>

<p data-aid="154070601" id="p8">The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ atoned for our sins. The Book of Mormon expands our understanding of Christ&#x2019;s sacrifice and suffering in important ways. You can find some of these teachings in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.7?lang=eng#p7">Mosiah 3:7</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.5-9?lang=eng#p5">15:5&#x2013;9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13?lang=eng#p11">Alma 7:11&#x2013;13</a>. After you read these passages, consider recording what you discover in a chart like this one:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070612" id="p9">What did the Savior suffer?</p>
</th><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070625" id="p10">Why did He suffer?</p>
</th><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070637" id="p11">What does this mean to me?</p>
</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table>
<p data-aid="154070682" id="p12">Here&#x2019;s another way to study these passages: Look for hymns that you feel match the messages they teach. The &#x201C;Scriptures&#x201D; index at the back of the hymnbook can help. What phrases from these hymns and the scriptures help you appreciate the Savior&#x2019;s sacrifice more deeply?</p>

<p data-aid="154070735" id="p14">It could be said that the Book of Mormon is an account of people who changed because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

<p data-aid="154070853" id="p22">The Book of Mormon gives many examples of people who were changed because of the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement. Perhaps your children could choose one to learn about, such as Enos (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.2-8?lang=eng#p2">Enos 1:2&#x2013;8</a>), Alma the Younger (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.8-24?lang=eng#p8">Mosiah 27:8&#x2013;24</a>), or the Anti-Nephi-Lehies (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.7-19?lang=eng#p7">Alma 24:7&#x2013;19</a>). How did this person or group change because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ? How can we follow their examples?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070863" id="p23">You and your children could also compare something clean and something dirty and talk about how dirty things are made clean. Read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.11-13?lang=eng#p11">Alma 13:11&#x2013;13</a>. What did Jesus do so that we can be made clean from our sins? How does this make us feel about sin? How does it make us feel about the Savior?</p>
