            <li id="hel_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the forty and second year of the reign of the judges, after Moronihah had established again peace between the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the judgment-seat; therefore there began to be a contention again among the people concerning who should fill the judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, who had entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment-seat to destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto him a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of his desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the judgment-seat that he might murder Helaman.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their secret plan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan.  And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him.  And they took their flight out of the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be found.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter.  And thus ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean the end of the book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have written.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the forty and third year of the reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And there was no contention among the people in the forty and fourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth year.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea, there was much contention and many dissensions; in the which there were an exceedingly great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land northward to inherit the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they did travel to an exceedingly great distance, insomuch that they came to large bodies of water and many rivers.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate and without timber, because of the many inhabitants who had before inherited the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber; but because of the greatness of the destruction of the people who had before inhabited the land it was called desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there being but little timber upon the face of the land, nevertheless the people who went forth became exceedingly expert in the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to the sea east.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the people who were in the land northward did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should grow up, that in time they might have timber to build their houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their buildings.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass as timber was exceedingly scarce in the land northward, they did send forth much by the way of shipping.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus they did enable the people in the land northward that they might build many cities, both of wood and of cement.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that there were many of the people of Ammon, who were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now there are many records kept of the proceedings of this people, by many of this people, which are particular and very large, concerning them.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions, and dissensions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping and their building of ships, and their building of temples, and of synagogues and their sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and their wickedness, and their murders, and their robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But behold, there are many books and many records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And they have been handed down from one generation to another by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now I return again to mine account; therefore, what I have spoken had passed after there had been great contentions, and disturbances, and wars, and dissensions, among the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended;</li>
            <li id="hel_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that there was still great contention in the land, yea, even in the forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that he had two sons.  He gave unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of Lehi.  And they began to grow up unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to cease, in a small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the robber had established in the more settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those who were at the head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that in this same year there was exceedingly great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there were thousands who did join themselves unto the church and were baptized unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even the high priests and the teachers were themselves astonished beyond measure.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper unto the baptizing and uniting to the church of God, many souls, yea, even tens of thousands.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_3.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And in this year there was continual rejoicing in the land of Zarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that there was peace and exceedingly great joy in the remainder of the forty and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual peace and great joy in the fiftieth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the judges there was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter into the church&#x2014;not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_3.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And they were lifted up in pride, even to the persecution of many of their brethren.  Now this was a great evil, which did cause the more humble part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much affliction.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceedingly great pride which had gotten into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass in the fifty and third year of the reign of the judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead.  And it came to pass that he did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One&#x2014;yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!</li>
            <li id="hel_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom&#x2019;s paths!</li>
            <li id="hel_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, behold at his voice do the hills and the mountains tremble and quake.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And by the power of his voice they are broken up, and become smooth, yea, even like unto a valley.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, by the power of his voice doth the whole earth shake;</li>
            <li id="hel_12.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, by the power of his voice, do the foundations rock, even to the very center.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, and if he say unto the earth&#x2014;Move&#x2014;it is moved.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, if he say unto the earth&#x2014;Thou shalt go back, that it lengthen out the day for many hours&#x2014;it is done;</li>
            <li id="hel_12.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And thus, according to his word the earth goeth back, and it appeareth unto man that the sun standeth still; yea, and behold, this is so; for surely it is the earth that moveth and not the sun.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, also, if he say unto the waters of the great deep&#x2014;Be thou dried up&#x2014;it is done.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Behold, if he say unto this mountain&#x2014;Be thou raised up, and come over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up&#x2014;behold it is done.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, if a man hide up a treasure in the earth, and the Lord shall say&#x2014;Let it be accursed, because of the iniquity of him who hath hid it up&#x2014;behold, it shall be accursed.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And if the Lord shall say&#x2014;Be thou accursed, that no man shall find thee from this time henceforth and forever&#x2014;behold, no man getteth it henceforth and forever.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, if the Lord shall say unto a man&#x2014;Because of thine iniquities, thou shalt be accursed forever&#x2014;it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And if the Lord shall say&#x2014;Because of thine iniquities thou shalt be cut off from my presence&#x2014;he will cause that it shall be so.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And wo unto him to whom he shall say this, for it shall be unto him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this cause, that men might be saved, hath repentance been declared.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Therefore, blessed are they who will repent and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And may God grant, in his great fulness, that men might be brought unto repentance and good works, that they might be restored unto grace for grace, according to their works.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And I would that all men might be saved.  But we read that in the great and last day there are some who shall be cast out, yea, who shall be cast off from the presence of the Lord;</li>
            <li id="hel_12.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Yea, who shall be consigned to a state of endless misery, fulfilling the words which say: They that have done good shall have everlasting life; and they that have done evil shall have everlasting damnation.

            <li id="hel_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the reign of the judges had ended, all these things had happened and the Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness and their steadiness in the faith.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, there were many of the Nephites who had become hardened and impenitent and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of God and all the preaching and prophesying which did come among them.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy because of the conversion of the Lamanites, yea, because of the church of God, which had been established among them.  And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did come down into the land of Zarahemla, and did declare unto the people of the Nephites the manner of their conversion, and did exhort them to faith and repentance.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and many did preach with exceedingly great power and authority, unto the bringing down many of them into the depths of humility, to be the humble followers of God and the Lamb.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did go into the land northward; and also Nephi and Lehi went into the land northward, to preach unto the people.  And thus ended the sixty and third year.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, there was peace in all the land, insomuch that the Nephites did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether among the Nephites or the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go whithersoever they would, whether it were among the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus they did have free intercourse one with another, to buy and to sell, and to get gain, according to their desire.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they became exceedingly rich, both the Lamanites and the Nephites; and they did have an exceeding plenty of gold, and of silver, and of all manner of precious metals, both in the land south and in the land north.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now the land south was called Lehi, and the land north was called Mulek, which was after the son of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land south.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, there was all manner of gold in both these lands, and of silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there were also curious workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and did refine it; and thus they did become rich.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in the south; and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north and in the south.  And they did multiply and wax exceedingly strong in the land.  And they did raise many flocks and herds, yea, many fatlings.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold their women did toil and spin, and did make all manner of cloth, of fine-twined linen and cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness.  And thus the sixty and fourth year did pass away in peace.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And in the sixty and fifth year they did also have great joy and peace, yea, much preaching and many prophecies concerning that which was to come.  And thus passed away the sixty and fifth year.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that in the sixty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, behold, Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand as he sat upon the judgment-seat.  And it came to pass that in the same year, that his son, who had been appointed by the people in his stead, was also murdered.  And thus ended the sixty and sixth year.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And in the commencement of the sixty and seventh year the people began to grow exceedingly wicked again.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches of the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodshed; therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit secret murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they might get gain.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band who had been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton.  And now it had come to pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton&#x2019;s band.  But behold, they were more numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites.  And they were called Gadianton&#x2019;s robbers and murderers.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it was they who did murder the chief judge Cezoram, and his son, while in the judgment-seat; and behold, they were not found.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that there were robbers among them they were exceedingly sorrowful; and they did use every means in their power to destroy them off the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more part of the Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter into their covenants and their oaths, that they would protect and preserve one another in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be placed, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their stealings.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And whosoever of those who belonged to their band should reveal unto the world of their wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not according to the laws of their country, but according to the laws of their wickedness, which had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now behold, it is these secret oaths and covenants which Alma commanded his son should not go forth unto the world, lest they should be a means of bringing down the people unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, they were put into the heart of Gadianton by that same being who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_6.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, that same being who did plot with Cain, that if he would murder his brother Abel it should not be known unto the world.  And he did plot with Cain and his followers from that time forth.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven.  And it was that same being who led on the people who came from that tower into this land; who spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of Gadianton to still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he has brought it forth from the beginning of man even down to this time.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And behold, it is he who is the author of all sin.  And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the way of righteousness, and did trample under their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto themselves idols of their gold and their silver.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years, insomuch that a more part of it had come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And they did grow in their iniquities in the sixty and eighth year also, to the great sorrow and lamentation of the righteous.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among the more wicked part of them, insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly destroyed from among the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did build them up and support them, beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they had overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of the righteous until they had come down to believe in their works and partake of their spoils, and to join with them in their secret murders and combinations.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government, insomuch that they did trample under their feet and smite and rend and turn their backs upon the poor and the meek, and the humble followers of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And thus we see that they were in an awful state, and ripening for an everlasting destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

            <li id="hel_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi delivered up the judgment-seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For as their laws and their governments were established by the voice of the people, and they who chose evil were more numerous than they who chose good, therefore they were ripening for destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, and this was not all; they were a stiffnecked people, insomuch that they could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary because of their iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment-seat, and took it upon him to preach the word of God all the remainder of his days, and his brother Lehi also, all the remainder of his days;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto them.  And these are the words which he spake:</li>
            <li id="hel_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words.  Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the city of Ammonihah; for he said unto him that the Lord surely should come to redeem his people, but that he should not come to redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them from their sins because of repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which are written.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And from thenceforth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid to the city of Mulek;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And even from one city to another, until they had gone forth among all the people of Nephi who were in the land southward; and from thence into the land of Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that they did preach with great power, insomuch that they did confound many of those dissenters who had gone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance, and immediately returned to the Nephites to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak, and they also had what they should speak given unto them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and round about baptized unto repentance, and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the Lamanites and cast into prison; yea, even in that same prison in which Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And after they had been cast into prison many days without food, behold, they went forth into the prison to take them that they might slay them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear lest they should be burned.  Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not burned.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And when they saw that they were encircled about with a pillar of fire, and that it burned them not, their hearts did take courage.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands upon them; neither durst they come near unto them, but stood as if they were struck dumb with amazement.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth and began to speak unto them, saying: Fear not, for behold, it is God that has shown unto you this marvelous thing, in the which is shown unto you that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And behold, when they had said these words, the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison did shake as if they were about to tumble to the earth; but behold, they did not fall.  And behold, they that were in the prison were Lamanites and Nephites who were dissenters.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud of darkness, and an awful solemn fear came upon them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that there came a voice as if it were above the cloud of darkness, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to destroy my servants whom I have sent unto you to declare good tidings.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And notwithstanding the mildness of the voice, behold the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison trembled again, as if it were about to tumble to the earth; and behold the cloud of darkness, which had overshadowed them, did not disperse&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And behold the voice came again, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and seek no more to destroy my servants.  And it came to pass that the earth shook again, and the walls trembled.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And also again the third time the voice came, and did speak unto them marvelous words which cannot be uttered by man; and the walls did tremble again, and the earth shook as if it were about to divide asunder.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee because of the cloud of darkness which did overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable because of the fear which did come upon them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Now there was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who had once belonged to the church of God but had dissented from them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw through the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did shine exceedingly, even as the faces of angels.  And he beheld that they did lift their eyes to heaven; and they were in the attitude as if talking or lifting their voices to some being whom they beheld.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude, that they might turn and look.  And behold, there was power given unto them that they did turn and look; and they did behold the faces of Nephi and Lehi.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And they said unto the man: Behold, what do all these things mean, and who is it with whom these men do converse?</li>
            <li id="hel_5.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Now the man&#x2019;s name was Aminadab.  And Aminadab said unto them: They do converse with the angels of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?</li>
            <li id="hel_5.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And Aminadab said unto them: You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the voice of him who had shaken the earth; yea, they did cry even until the cloud of darkness was dispersed.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and saw that the cloud of darkness was dispersed from overshadowing them, behold, they saw that they were encircled about, yea every soul, by a pillar of fire.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> And Nephi and Lehi were in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison; and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And behold, the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and did enter into their hearts, and they were filled as if with fire, and they could speak forth marvelous words.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And it came to pass that there came a voice unto them, yea, a pleasant voice, as if it were a whisper, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_5.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my Well Beloved, who was from the foundation of the world.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> And now, when they heard this they cast up their eyes as if to behold from whence the voice came; and behold, they saw the heavens open; and angels came down out of heaven and ministered unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And there were about three hundred souls who saw and heard these things; and they were bidden to go forth and marvel not, neither should they doubt.</li>

            <li id="hel_5.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And as many as were convinced did lay down their weapons of war, and also their hatred and the tradition of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> And it came to pass that they did yield up unto the Nephites the lands of their possession.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that there arose a division among the people, insomuch that they divided hither and thither and went their ways, leaving Nephi alone, as he was standing in the midst of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own house, pondering upon the things which the Lord had shown unto him.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass as he was thus pondering&#x2014;being much cast down because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, their secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of iniquities&#x2014;and it came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came unto him saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people.  And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God.  Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple it shall be rent in twain, it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, if ye shall say that God shall smite this people, it shall come to pass.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now behold, I command you, that ye shall go and declare unto this people, that thus saith the Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except ye repent ye shall be smitten, even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these words unto Nephi, he did stop and did not go unto his own house, but did return unto the multitudes who were scattered about upon the face of the land, and began to declare unto them the word of the Lord which had been spoken unto him, concerning their destruction if they did not repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now behold, notwithstanding that great miracle which Nephi had done in telling them concerning the death of the chief judge, they did harden their hearts and did not hearken unto the words of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Nephi did declare unto them the word of the Lord, saying: Except ye repent, thus saith the Lord, ye shall be smitten even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that when Nephi had declared unto them the word, behold, they did still harden their hearts and would not hearken unto his words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to lay their hands upon him that they might cast him into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not take him to cast him into prison, for he was taken by the Spirit and conveyed away out of the midst of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit, from multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words; and there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided against themselves and began to slay one another with the sword.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

            <li id="hel_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year there were many dissensions in the church, and there was also a contention among the people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and they did go unto the king of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the Lamanites to war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites were exceedingly afraid, insomuch that they would not hearken to the words of those dissenters.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, there were dissenters who went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And in the fifty and seventh year they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in obtaining possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the Nephites and the armies of Moronihah were driven even into the land of Bountiful;</li>
            <li id="hel_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the west sea, even unto the east; it being a day&#x2019;s journey for a Nephite, on the line which they had fortified and stationed their armies to defend their north country.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a numerous army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession of the Nephites which was in the land southward.  And all this was done in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the reign of the judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies in obtaining many parts of the land; yea, they regained many cities which had fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass in the sixty and first year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in regaining even the half of all their possessions.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, would not have happened had it not been for their wickedness and their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among those also who professed to belong to the church of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering, lying, stealing, committing adultery, rising up in great contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the Lamanites&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost all their lands.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people because of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, who were the sons of Helaman, did preach many things unto the people, yea, and did prophesy many things unto them concerning their iniquities, and what should come unto them if they did not repent of their sins.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did repent they did begin to prosper.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For when Moronihah saw that they did repent he did venture to lead them forth from place to place, and from city to city, even until they had regained the one-half of their property and the one-half of all their lands.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass in the sixty and second year of the reign of the judges, that Moronihah could obtain no more possessions over the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the remainder of their lands, for so numerous were the Lamanites that it became impossible for the Nephites to obtain more power over them; therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in maintaining those parts which he had taken.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass, because of the greatness of the number of the Lamanites the Nephites were in great fear, lest they should be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also the words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a stiffnecked people, and that they had set at naught the commandments of God;</li>
            <li id="hel_4.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And that they had altered and trampled under their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and they saw that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And because of their iniquity the church had begun to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_4.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were exceedingly more numerous than they, and except they should cleave unto the Lord their God they must unavoidably perish.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great as their strength, even man for man.  And thus had they fallen into this great transgression; yea, thus had they become weak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many years.</li>

            <li id="hel_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass in the sixty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla from the land northward.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For he had been forth among the people who were in the land northward, and did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto them;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they did reject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among them, but returned again unto the land of his nativity.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the judgment-seats&#x2014;having usurped the power and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:</li>
            <li id="hel_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall be filled with sorrow because of this the wickedness of my brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by which led the highway.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower; and they ran and told the people what they had seen, and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people who had gathered together.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them: Behold, why have ye gathered yourselves together?  That I may tell you of your iniquities?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon your hearts.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, how could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> O repent ye, repent ye!  Why will ye die?  Turn ye, turn ye unto the Lord your God.  Why has he forsaken you?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him to anger against you.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye will repent, behold, he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> O, how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he has delivered you?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver.  And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent.  For if ye will not repent, behold, this great city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words. Now therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination which has come among you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea, to that secret band which was established by Gadianton!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Yea, wo shall come unto you because of that pride which ye have suffered to enter your hearts, which has lifted you up beyond that which is good because of your exceedingly great riches!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and abominations!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And except ye repent ye shall perish; yea, even your lands shall be taken from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Behold now, I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but behold, I know that these things are true because the Lord God has made them known unto me, therefore I testify that they shall be.</li>

            <li id="hel_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the reign of the judges that the contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land among all the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it was this secret band of robbers who did carry on this work of destruction and wickedness.  And this war did last all that year; and in the seventy and third year it did also last.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And so it was done, according to the words of Nephi.  And there was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi.  And thus in the seventy and fourth year the famine did continue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword but became sore by famine.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And this work of destruction did also continue in the seventy and fifth year.  For the earth was smitten that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their God; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the people began to plead with their chief judges and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that the judges did say unto Nephi, according to the words which had been desired.  And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that the people had repented and did humble themselves in sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them insomuch that they have become extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, O Lord, because of this their humility wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in the season of grain.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my words, for thou saidst that: If this people repent I will spare them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the famine and the pestilence and destruction which has come unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they will serve thee?  And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy words which thou hast said.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit.  And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did cover the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west to the sea east.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace.  And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by the prophets.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much strife.  But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain number who were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they became an exceedingly great band of robbers; and they did search out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into the wilderness and upon the mountains to search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> But behold, it came to pass that in that same year they were driven back even into their own lands.  And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first year they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and they were also visited with much destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness and out of the mountains unto their own lands, because of the exceeding greatness of the numbers of those robbers who infested the mountains and the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that thus ended this year.  And the robbers did still increase and wax strong, insomuch that they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come unto the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially their women and their children.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their iniquity, did stir them up again in remembrance of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And thus ended the eighty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And in the eighty and second year they began again to forget the Lord their God.  And in the eighty and third year they began to wax strong in iniquity.  And in the eighty and fourth year they did not mend their ways.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year they did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness; and thus they were ripening again for destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And thus ended the eighty and fifth year.</li>

            <li id="hel_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my beloved brethren, behold, I declare unto you that except ye shall repent your houses shall be left unto you desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to mourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt to flee and there shall be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them which are with child, for they shall be heavy and cannot flee; therefore, they shall be trodden down and shall be left to perish.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, wo unto this people who are called the people of Nephi except they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated because their deeds have been evil continually, and this because of the iniquity of the tradition of their fathers.  But behold, salvation hath come unto them through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their days.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments according to the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they are striving with unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the truth; therefore there are many who do add to their numbers daily.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it, that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war, and they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin; yea, ye can see that they fear to sin&#x2014;for behold they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their enemies, and will not lift their swords against them, and this because of their faith in Christ.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, because of their steadfastness when they do believe in that thing which they do believe, for because of their firmness when they are once enlightened, behold, the Lord shall bless them and prolong their days, notwithstanding their iniquity&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief the Lord shall prolong their days, until the time shall come which hath been spoken of by our fathers, and also by the prophet Zenos, and many other prophets, concerning the restoration of our brethren, the Lamanites, again to the knowledge of the truth&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the promises of the Lord have been extended to our brethren, the Lamanites; and notwithstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and notwithstanding they shall be driven to and fro upon the face of the earth, and be hunted, and shall be smitten and scattered abroad, having no place for refuge, the Lord shall be merciful unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again be brought to the true knowledge, which is the knowledge of their Redeemer, and their great and true shepherd, and be numbered among his sheep.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore I say unto you, it shall be better for them than for you except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, had the mighty works been shown unto them which have been shown unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in unbelief because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see of yourselves that they never would again have dwindled in unbelief.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, saith the Lord: I will not utterly destroy them, but I will cause that in the day of my wisdom they shall return again unto me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the Nephites: If they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I will utterly destroy them, saith the Lord, because of their unbelief notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have done among them; and as surely as the Lord liveth shall these things be, saith the Lord.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold, there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he has done?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people and against our law?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And those judges were angry with him because he spake plainly unto them concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for they feared the people lest they should cry out against them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer this man to revile against us?  For behold he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are powerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no power over us.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to anger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities.  And behold they are many, and he knoweth as well all things which shall befall us as he knoweth of our iniquities;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified concerning those things.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying: Behold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swallowed them up?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great power given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God should come?  And as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up who should come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And as many as should look upon that serpent should live, even so as many as should look upon the Son of God with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with gladness and did rejoice.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were many before the days of Abraham who were called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days of Abraham there have been many prophets that have testified these things; yea, behold, the prophet Zenos did testify boldly; for the which he was slain.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet who testified of the destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed according to the words of Jeremiah.  O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed?  Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek?  Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem?  But behold, this is not all&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he testified of these things.  Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because of that which is to come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot deny them except ye shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many evidences which ye have received; yea, even ye have received all things, both things in heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as a witness that they are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment.</li>

            <li id="hel_14.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a great many more things which cannot be written.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And behold, he said unto them: Behold, I give unto you a sign; for five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all those who shall believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold this is not all, there shall be many signs and wonders in heaven.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it shall come to pass that ye shall all be amazed, and wonder, insomuch that ye shall fall to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the Son of God, the same shall have everlasting life.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the way of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent have I come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judgments of God which do await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of his death.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death&#x2014;that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into the fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost there shall be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall shake and tremble; and the rocks which are upon the face of this earth, which are both above the earth and beneath, which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be found in seams and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth, yea, both above the earth and beneath.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places which are now called valleys which shall become mountains, whose height is great.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And behold, thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space of three days.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of this land, to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_16.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city.  And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working miracles among the people, that they might know that the Christ must shortly come&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and remember at the time of their coming that they had been made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing their sins.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus ended also the eighty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges, there were great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the scriptures began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon their own strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot come to pass, of which has been spoken.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to reason and to contend among themselves, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself unto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, why will he not show himself in this land as well as in the land of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield ourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And many more things did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman and his sons.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed away and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief judge and the governor over the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest son, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which had been kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man knoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead, yea, the record of this people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and greater miracles wrought among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath been vain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken might not come to pass.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord all that day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son&#x2014;of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh.  And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day.  And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the words of the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass also that a new star did appear, according to the word.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins.  And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses.  Now in this thing they did err, having not understood the scriptures.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were convinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known unto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass away till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year were they brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess their faults.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come to pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they began to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth year;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of Mosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was given, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come into the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of the records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be found in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had passed away the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction because of this war, which had become exceedingly sore.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites.  And thus ended the thirteenth year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret places.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And thus ended the fourteenth year.  And in the fifteenth year they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many contentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many advantages over them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people in a state of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of their iniquity.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word&#x2014;Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you with utter destruction.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us&#x2014;not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will command that my armies shall come down against you, and they shall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall become extinct.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been handed down unto us.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and government, who have dissented away from you because of your wickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs.  I am Giddianhi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in nowise be delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains over all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great commander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land Desolation.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land.  Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land northward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies.  And Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of every kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their secret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both which were in the land south and which were in the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found that it was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was no way that they could subsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land insomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from before them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain.  And thus was the end of Giddianhi the robber.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did return again to their place of security.  And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in the twentieth year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store,</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the wilderness insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with hunger.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by night, and falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by tens of thousands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, because of the great destruction which came upon them by night and by day.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and march into the furthermost parts of the land northward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of their weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their retreat.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front and in their rear.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in their places of retreat.  And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up prisoners unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were slain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead.  And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing, and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God.  And they did cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of all the holy prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that they must be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come, because of the many signs which had been given, according to the words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and night.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would murder no more were set at liberty.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have those secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against their brethren were condemned and punished according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret, and abominable combinations, in the which there was so much wickedness, and so many murders committed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the twenty and third year also, and the twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and thus had twenty and five years passed away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there had many things transpired which, in the eyes of some, would be great and marvelous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this book; yea, this book cannot contain even a hundredth part of what was done among so many people in the space of twenty and five years;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold there are records which do contain all the proceedings of this people; and a shorter but true account was given by Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore I have made my record of these things according to the record of Nephi, which was engraven on the plates which were called the plates of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, I do make the record on plates which I have made with mine own hands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people, yea, the first church which was established among them after their transgression.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it hath become expedient that I, according to the will of God, that the prayers of those who have gone hence, who were the holy ones, should be fulfilled according to their faith, should make a record of these things which have been done&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, a small record of that which hath taken place from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore I do make my record from the accounts which have been given by those who were before me, until the commencement of my day;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And then I do make a record of the things which I have seen with mine own eyes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And I know the record which I make to be a just and a true record; nevertheless there are many things which, according to our language, we are not able to write.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now I make an end of my saying, which is of myself, and proceed to give my account of the things which have been before me.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi.  I have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it were himself and those whom he brought out of that land) and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the salvation of our souls.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been merciful unto the seed of Joseph.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept his commandments he hath blessed them and prospered them according to his word.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of Joseph to the knowledge of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And as surely as the Lord liveth, will he gather in from the four quarters of the earth all the remnant of the seed of Jacob, who are scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And as he hath covenanted with all the house of Jacob, even so shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house of Jacob be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the restoring all the house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant that he hath covenanted with them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And then shall they know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four quarters of the earth unto their own lands, from whence they have been dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shall it be.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all return to their own lands in the twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and his cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their provisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and they did return to their own lands and their possessions, both on the north and on the south, both on the land northward and on the land southward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and those who had been appointed leaders, who had established this great peace in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and there were many old cities repaired.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had continual peace.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began to be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride and boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers, and many officers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this&#x2014;Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do all manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a few years.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year&#x2014;the people having been delivered up for the space of a long time to be carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should&#x2014;and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel against God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did govern the people that year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent forth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry because of those who testified of these things; and those who were angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been high priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers were angry with those who testified of these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could have power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation was signed by the governor of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now there were many of those who testified of the things pertaining to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put to death secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their death came not unto the governor of the land until after their death.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that any man should be put to death except they had power from the governor of the land&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned the prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up before the judge, to be judged of the crime which they had done, according to the law which had been given by the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and the high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with the kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine against all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord, and enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those who were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be administered according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their country; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the governor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land should no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a king over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon the judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the people were divided one against another; and they did separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and thus they became tribes and leaders of tribes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much family and many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes became exceedingly great.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they did yield themselves unto the power of Satan.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the regulations of the government were destroyed, because of the secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those who murdered the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch that the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become wicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had given his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes of the people, who were united together save it were their leaders did establish their laws, every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred of those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the government.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people.  And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they were divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders.  But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that Nephi&#x2014;having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds&#x2014;went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book.  And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Thus passed away the thirty and second year also.  And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with water.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a remission of their sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did keep the record&#x2014;for he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed away;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the time that there should be darkness for the space of three days over the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among the people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it was about to divide asunder.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had been known in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were drowned.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in the place of the city there became a great mountain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And there was a great and terrible destruction in the land southward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the land northward; for behold, the whole face of the land was changed, because of the tempest and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings and the lightnings, and the exceedingly great quaking of the whole earth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled, and many smooth places became rough.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And many great and notable cities were sunk, and many were burned, and many were shaken till the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain, and the places were left desolate.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And there were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was exceedingly great, and there were many in them who were slain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there were some who were carried away in the whirlwind; and whither they went no man knoweth, save they know that they were carried away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found in broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease&#x2014;for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours&#x2014;and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen could feel the vapor of darkness;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any light at all;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great city Moronihah.  And thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that in this year there was one Samuel, a Lamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people.  And it came to pass that he did preach, many days, repentance unto the people, and they did cast him out, and he was about to return to his own land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, that he should return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things should come into his heart.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should enter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the wall thereof, and stretched forth his hand and cried with a loud voice, and prophesied unto the people whatsoever things the Lord put into his heart.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, heavy destruction awaiteth this people, and it surely cometh unto this people, and nothing can save this people save it be repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, who surely shall come into the world, and shall suffer many things and shall be slain for his people.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, an angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he did bring glad tidings to my soul.  And behold, I was sent unto you to declare it unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but behold ye would not receive me.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will withdraw my Spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And four hundred years shall not pass away before I will cause that they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword and with famine and with pestilence.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of the fourth generation who shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter destruction; and this shall surely come except ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth generation shall visit your destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord your God I will turn away mine anger, saith the Lord; yea, thus saith the Lord, blessed are they who will repent and turn unto me, but wo unto him that repenteth not.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for behold, it is because of those who are righteous that it is saved; yea, wo unto this great city, for I perceive, saith the Lord, that there are many, yea, even the more part of this great city, that will harden their hearts against me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But blessed are they who will repent, for them will I spare.  But behold, if it were not for the righteous who are in this great city, behold, I would cause that fire should come down out of heaven and destroy it.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, it is for the righteous&#x2019; sake that it is spared.  But behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall cast out the righteous from among you, then shall ye be ripe for destruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of the wickedness and abominations which are in her.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the wickedness and abominations which are in her.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, and wo be unto all the cities which are in the land round about, which are possessed by the Nephites, because of the wickedness and abominations which are in them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And behold, a curse shall come upon the land, saith the Lord of Hosts, because of the people&#x2019;s sake who are upon the land, yea, because of their wickedness and their abominations.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the earth shall find them again no more, because of the great curse of the land, save he be a righteous man and shall hide it up unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their treasures unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up their treasures unto me; for none hideth up their treasures unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasures unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because they have set their hearts upon riches; and because they have set their hearts upon their riches, and will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before their enemies; because they will not hide them up unto me, cursed be they and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my words; yea, hearken unto the words which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye are cursed because of your riches, and also are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon them, and have not hearkened unto the words of him who gave them unto you.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a curse should come upon the land, and also upon your riches, and this because of your iniquities.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arrived, that ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do slay them, and do all manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old time.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of our fathers of old, we would not have slain the prophets; we would not have stoned them, and cast them out.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a sinner, and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth&#x2014;and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he is a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh flattering words unto you, and he saith that all is well, then ye will not find fault with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you?  Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides?  Yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light?</li>
            <li id="hel_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you; behold, he hath cursed the land because of your iniquity.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that they become slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And in the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts.  And then shall ye lament, and say:</li>
            <li id="hel_13.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> O that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out.  Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and behold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought them for battle.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they have slipped away from us, because of the curse of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we cannot hold them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls.  Behold, our iniquities are great.  O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us?  And this shall be your language in those days.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words!  And I pray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be saved.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings shall become desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the covenant to your fathers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words, behold, they began to weep and howl again because of the loss of their kindred and friends.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away.  And it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled which had been spoken by the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not carried away in the whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him search them, and see and behold if all these deaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by tempests, and by whirlwinds, and by the opening of the earth to receive them, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of these things at the coming of Christ, and were slain because they testified of these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these things, and also Zenock spake concerning these things, because they testified particularly concerning us, who are the remnant of their seed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Behold, our father Jacob also testified concerning a remnant of the seed of Joseph.  And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph?  And these things which testify of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and fourth year, behold, I will show unto you that the people of Nephi who were spared, and also those who had been called Lamanites, who had been spared, did have great favors shown unto them, and great blessings poured out upon their heads, insomuch that soon after the ascension of Christ into heaven he did truly manifest himself unto them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Showing his body unto them, and ministering unto them; and an account of his ministry shall be given hereafter.  Therefore for this time I make an end of my sayings.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that there was a voice heard among all the inhabitants of the earth, upon all the face of this land, crying:</li>

            <li id="3 ne_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the people of king Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire because of their sins and their wickedness, which was above all the wickedness of the whole earth, because of their secret murders and combinations; for it was they that did destroy the peace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I did cause them to be burned, to destroy them from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up unto me any more against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I caused to be burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, because of their wickedness in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I did send to declare unto them concerning their wickedness and their abominations.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous among them, I did send down fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I sent among them might not cry unto me from the ground against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And many great destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and upon this people, because of their wickedness and their abominations.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_9.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit.  And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me at the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.</li>

Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these words, certain men who were among them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, even there were five who went, and they said among themselves, as they went:</li>
            <li id="hel_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Behold, now we will know of a surety whether this man be a prophet and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous things unto us.  Behold, we do not believe that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that he be dead, then will we believe that the other words which he has spoken are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto the judgment-seat; and behold, the chief judge had fallen to the earth, and did lie in his blood.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now behold, when they saw this they were astonished exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not believed the words which Nephi had spoken concerning the chief judge.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them lest all the judgments which Nephi had spoken should come upon the people; therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, immediately when the judge had been murdered&#x2014;he being stabbed by his brother by a garb of secrecy, and he fled, and the servants ran and told the people, raising the cry of murder among them;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold the people did gather themselves together unto the place of the judgment-seat&#x2014;and behold, to their astonishment they saw those five men who had fallen to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the multitude who had gathered together at the garden of Nephi; therefore they said among themselves: These men are they who have murdered the judge, and God has smitten them that they could not flee from us.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound them and cast them into prison.  And there was a proclamation sent abroad that the judge was slain, and that the murderers had been taken and were cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow the people did assemble themselves together to mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great chief judge who had been slain.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus also those judges who were at the garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying: Where are the five who were sent to inquire concerning the chief judge whether he was dead?  And they answered and said: Concerning this five whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but there are five who are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the judges desired that they should be brought; and they were brought, and behold they were the five who were sent; and behold the judges inquired of them to know concerning the matter, and they told them all that they had done, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> We ran and came to the place of the judgment-seat, and when we saw all things even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished insomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast us into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now, as for the murder of this man, we know not who has done it; and only this much we know, we ran and came according as ye desired, and behold he was dead, according to the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold, we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the burial.  Nevertheless, they did rebuke the judges in the words which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways that they might cross him, that they might accuse him to death&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath done this murder?  Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault; saying, Behold here is money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement which thou hast made with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But Nephi said unto them: O ye fools, ye uncircumcised of heart, ye blind, and ye stiffnecked people, do ye know how long the Lord your God will suffer you that ye shall go on in this your way of sin?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> O ye ought to begin to howl and mourn, because of the great destruction which at this time doth await you, except ye shall repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Behold ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should murder Seezoram, our chief judge.  But behold, I say unto you, that this is because I have testified unto you that ye might know concerning this thing; yea, even for a witness unto you, that I did know of the wickedness and abominations which are among you.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And because I have done this, ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should do this thing; yea, because I showed unto you this sign ye are angry with me, and seek to destroy my life.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now behold, I will show unto you another sign, and see if ye will in this thing seek to destroy me.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold I say unto you: Go to the house of Seantum, who is the brother of Seezoram, and say unto him&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Has Nephi, the pretended prophet, who doth prophesy so much evil concerning this people, agreed with thee, in the which ye have murdered Seezoram, who is your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And behold, he shall say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And ye shall say unto him: Have ye murdered your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And he shall stand with fear, and wist not what to say.  And behold, he shall deny unto you; and he shall make as if he were astonished; nevertheless, he shall declare unto you that he is innocent.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But behold, ye shall examine him, and ye shall find blood upon the skirts of his cloak.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And when ye have seen this, ye shall say: From whence cometh this blood?  Do we not know that it is the blood of your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And then shall he tremble, and shall look pale, even as if death had come upon him.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And then shall ye say: Because of this fear and this paleness which has come upon your face, behold, we know that thou art guilty.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And then shall greater fear come upon him; and then shall he confess unto you, and deny no more that he has done this murder.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And then shall he say unto you, that I, Nephi, know nothing concerning the matter save it were given unto me by the power of God.  And then shall ye know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent unto you from God.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as Nephi had said unto them.  And behold, the words which he had said were true; for according to the words he did deny; and also according to the words he did confess.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And he was brought to prove that he himself was the very murderer, insomuch that the five were set at liberty, and also was Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And there were some of the Nephites who believed on the words of Nephi; and there were some also, who believed because of the testimony of the five, for they had been converted while they were in prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And now there were some among the people, who said that Nephi was a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And there were others who said: Behold, he is a god, for except he was a god he could not know of all things.  For behold, he has told us the thoughts of our hearts, and also has told us things; and even he has brought unto our knowledge the true murderer of our chief judge.</li>

<p data-aid="154411363" id="p1">In some ways, it was an exciting time to be a believer in Jesus Christ. Prophecies were being fulfilled&#x2014;great signs and miracles among the people indicated that the Savior would soon be born. On the other hand, it was also an anxious time for believers because, in spite of all the miracles, unbelievers insisted that &#x201C;the time was past&#x201D; for the Savior to be born (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:5</a>). These people caused &#x201C;a great uproar throughout the land&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:7</a>) and even set a date to kill all the believers if the sign prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite&#x2014;a night without darkness&#x2014;did not appear.</p>
<p data-aid="154411366" id="p2">In these difficult circumstances, the prophet Nephi &#x201C;cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:11</a>). The Lord&#x2019;s response is inspiring to anyone who faces persecution or doubt and needs to know that light will overcome darkness: &#x201C;Lift up your head and be of good cheer; &#x2026; I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:13</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154411438" id="p15">Your Heavenly Father knows that your life will include moments that are difficult, even frightening. But He also wants you to experience joy. Read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p23#p1">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:1&#x2013;23</a> to learn about the reasons the faithful Nephites had to be afraid. What reason did the Lord give them to &#x201C;be of good cheer&#x201D;?</p>
<p data-aid="154411441" id="p16">The Savior has used the phrase &#x201C;be of good cheer&#x201D; on several occasions&#x2014;for example, in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p24-p27#p24">Matthew 14:24&#x2013;27</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p33#p33">John 16:33</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61?lang=eng&amp;id=p36#p36">Doctrine and Covenants 61:36</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78?lang=eng&amp;id=p17-p19#p17">78:17&#x2013;19</a>. What impresses you about these invitations? You might read surrounding verses to understand the circumstances in which the Savior said these words. In each case, what reasons did He give to help people face their fears? How has he done this for you?</p>
<p data-aid="154411443" id="p17">Consider studying President Russell&#xA0;M. Nelson&#x2019;s address &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2016/10/joy-and-spiritual-survival?lang=eng">Joy and Spiritual Survival</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2016, 81&#x2013;84). What does President Nelson teach you about finding joy in any situation? Notice how many times President Nelson uses the word focus. Maybe you could compare focusing a camera or other lens to focusing on Jesus Christ. How will you focus on Him more?</p>

<p data-aid="154412105" id="p1">The book of Helaman records both triumphs and tragedies among the Nephites and Lamanites.

Here we read about political intrigue, bands of robbers, rejection of the prophets, and pride and disbelief throughout the land. But we also find examples like Nephi and Lehi and &#x201C;the more humble part of the people,&#x201D; who not only survived but thrived spiritually (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p34#p34">Helaman 3:34</a>). How did they do it? How did they stay strong while their civilization began to decline and fall apart? The same way any of us stay strong in the &#x201C;mighty storm&#x201D; the devil sends to &#x201C;beat upon [us]&#x201D;&#x2014;by building our lives &#x201C;upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, &#x2026; a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12">Helaman 5:12</a>).</p>

When they are righteous, God blesses them, and they prosper. After a time, they become prideful and wicked, making choices that lead to destruction and suffering. Then they are humbled and inspired to repent, and God blesses them once again. The pattern repeats itself so often that some call it the &#x201C;pride cycle.&#x201D;</p>

To depict <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12">Helaman 5:12</a>, you could build a small structure on different kinds of foundations.

<p data-aid="154412136" id="p15">Consider using a picture of a temple to start a conversation about why buildings need strong foundations. Or you could look at the foundation of your home or Church building. To emphasize the strength of a rock-solid foundation, your children could try to move a rock by blowing on it. As you read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12">Helaman 5:12</a>, ask your children why Jesus Christ is &#x201C;a sure foundation&#x201D; for our lives. How can we build our lives on Him? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p27-p29,35#p27">Helaman 3:27&#x2013;29,&#xA0;35</a> and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p4#p4">Articles of Faith 1:4</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154412137" id="p16">Invite your children to build a tower using blocks or other materials on different kinds of foundations (such as cotton balls or a flat stone). How is the solid foundation like Jesus Christ? They could add a block to the structure for each idea they share about what they can do to follow Him.</p>

<p data-aid="154410317" id="p1">The first time Samuel the Lamanite tried to share &#x201C;glad tidings&#x201D; in Zarahemla (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7">Helaman 13:7</a>), he was rejected and cast out by the hard-hearted Nephites. You might say it was as if they had built an impenetrable wall around their hearts that prevented them from receiving Samuel&#x2019;s message. Samuel understood the importance of the message he bore and demonstrated faith by following God&#x2019;s commandment &#x201C;that he should return again, and prophesy&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">Helaman 13:3</a>). Like Samuel, we all encounter walls as we &#x201C;prepare the way of the Lord&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p9#p9">Helaman 14:9</a>) and strive to follow His prophets. And like Samuel, we too bear witness of Jesus Christ, &#x201C;who surely shall come,&#x201D; and invite all to &#x201C;believe on his name&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">Helaman 13:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">14:13</a>). Not everyone will listen, and some may actively oppose us.

</header>
<p data-aid="154410330" id="p2">In the scriptures, prophets are sometimes compared to watchmen on a wall or tower who warn of danger (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/isa/62?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">Isaiah 62:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p7#p1">Ezekiel 33:1&#x2013;7</a>). As you study Samuel&#x2019;s words in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng">Helaman&#xA0;13</a>, consider how he is like a watchman for you. What did he say that seems relevant to our day? (see especially <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p8,21-p22,26-p29,31,38#p8">verses 8, 21&#x2013;22, 26&#x2013;29,&#xA0;31, and&#xA0;38</a>). For example, what did Samuel teach about repentance? about humility and wealth? about seeking happiness &#x201C;in doing iniquity&#x201D;?</p>
<p data-aid="154410332" id="p3">You might also search recent conference messages for similar warnings the Lord has given through modern prophets. What do you feel inspired to do about these warnings?</p>
<figure class="for-teacher" data-purpose="teaching-improvement" id="figure2">
<p data-aid="154410335" id="figure2_p1"><strong>Look for patterns.</strong> A pattern is a plan or model that can be used as a guide for accomplishing a task. In the scriptures, we find patterns that show how the Lord accomplishes His work, such as sending His servants to warn the people.</p>

<p data-aid="154410348" id="p4">Samuel&#x2019;s warnings of the judgments of God consistently included a merciful invitation to repent. Look for these invitations throughout <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng">Helaman 13&#x2013;15</a> (see especially <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p11#p6">Helaman 13:6&#x2013;11</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p19#p15">14:15&#x2013;19</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p7-p8#p7">15:7&#x2013;8</a>). What do you learn from these verses about repentance? Some people see repentance as a harsh punishment&#x2014;something to avoid. In your opinion, how did Samuel want the Nephites to see repentance?</p>
<p data-aid="154410352" id="p5">To deepen your study, you could read President Russell&#xA0;M. Nelson&#x2019;s message &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson?lang=eng">We Can Do Better and Be Better</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, May 2019, 67). How does he define repentance? What blessings of sincere repentance do you find in his message? You might also look for specific things the prophet invited us to change. What is the Holy Ghost telling you that you need to change? Consider writing down the personal revelation you receive.</p>
<p data-aid="154410356" id="p6">How is repentance different than just changing your behavior? Why is it important to accept God&#x2019;s invitation to repent? As you ponder this, consider singing or listening to a hymn that expresses this invitation, such as &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/how-gentle-gods-commands?lang=eng">How Gentle God&#x2019;s Commands</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;125).</p>

<p data-aid="154410416" id="p12">Samuel&#x2019;s words contain many stern chastisements, but <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">Helaman 15:3</a> gives us perspective on chastening from the Lord. How can chastisement from the Lord be a sign of His love? What evidence do you see of the Lord&#x2019;s love and mercy in Samuel&#x2019;s prophecies and warnings?</p>

<p data-aid="154410477" id="p15">How can you teach your children that God can speak to our heart, as He did for Samuel? Perhaps you could ask them to show you different ways to communicate without words (such as gestures or facial expressions). This could lead to a discussion about different ways that Heavenly Father communicates with us. As part of this discussion, you and your children could look at a picture of Samuel the Lamanite (this outline has two) and read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p2-p5#p2">Helaman 13:2&#x2013;5</a> as your children listen for how God told Samuel what to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154410484" id="p16">Many of us&#x2014;especially children&#x2014;need help learning to recognize <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> God is speaking to us. You might tell your children about a time when the Holy Ghost helped you know in your heart what God wanted you to do or say. Explain how you knew that God was communicating with you. Perhaps your children could also share any similar experiences they have had.</p>
