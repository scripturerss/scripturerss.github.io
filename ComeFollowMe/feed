        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having gone the way of all the earth, having warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless he had established laws, and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide by the laws which he had made.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of Alma in the judgment-seat, there was a man brought before him to be judged, a man who was large, and was noted for his much strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give him money.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a church after the manner of his preaching.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an instrument in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him.  Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be judged according to the crimes which he had committed.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pled for himself with much boldness.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that priestcraft has been introduced among this people.  And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to spare thee his blood would come upon us for vengeance.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore thou art condemned to die, according to the law which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been acknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by the law.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was Nehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious death.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft through the land; for there were many who loved the vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false doctrines; and this they did for the sake of riches and honor.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of the law, for liars were punished; therefore they pretended to preach according to their belief; and now the law could have no power on any man for his belief.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And they durst not steal, for fear of the law, for such were punished; neither durst they rob, nor murder, for he that murdered was punished unto death.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of God began to persecute those that did belong to the church of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all manner of words, and this because of their humility; because they were not proud in their own eyes, and because they did impart the word of God, one with another, without money and without price.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their fists.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God.  And also many withdrew themselves from among them.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God.  And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need&#x2014;an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.</li>
            <li id="alma_1.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Who art thou?  Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not that the earth should pass away.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did not.  And I stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of Jerusalem by the hand of God?  Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through the wilderness?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.  But behold, this is not all&#x2014;he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land?  And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence of the Lord.  Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who call on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce anger of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to destroy his people.  I say unto you, Nay; he would rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after having had so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea, after having been favored above every other nation, kindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made known unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which is to come;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of translation;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of things&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people and to answer their prayers.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they have been&#x2014;if they have been righteous they shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are meet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost and a fallen people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a fallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they should take me at that time and cast me into prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to preach unto them also.  And now the words of Amulek are not all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the fifth year of their reign there began to be a contention among the people; for a certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed according to the law&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be a king over the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves together throughout all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in their voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Amlici, that he was not made king over the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor to anger against those who were not in his favor.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together, and did consecrate Amlici to be their king.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he did that he might subject them to him.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici, being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called Nephites, or the people of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons of war, of every kind.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of their coming.  And there were appointed captains, and higher captains, and chief captains, according to their numbers.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all manner of weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against their brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the people of Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidon.  And the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall before the Amlicites.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that they began to flee before them.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all that day, and did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in the valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites, that he might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he might guard himself against them, that he might preserve his people from being destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the Amlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the camp of the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much fear, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_2.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our great astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites; and behold, the Amlicites have joined them;</li>
            <li id="alma_2.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their tents, and departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their city, which was the city of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword, face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with another.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, being exercised with much faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and spare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save and preserve this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici with the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his guards to contend with Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the king of the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river Sidon that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not be numbered.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness which was west and north, away beyond the borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay them.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until they were scattered on the west, and on the north, until they had reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that part of the wilderness which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts.</li>
            <li id="alma_2.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their wounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped up on the earth.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers?  Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them?  And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God.  Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they were not.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed?  I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love.  And I say unto you that they are saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved?  Yea, what grounds had they to hope for salvation?  What is the cause of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of hell?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Behold, I can tell you&#x2014;did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi?  And was he not a holy prophet?  Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart.  Behold I say unto you that this is all true.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God.  And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God?  Have ye received his image in your countenances?  Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you?  Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that day, and say&#x2014;Lord, our works have been righteous works upon the face of the earth&#x2014;and that he will save you?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands?  I say unto you, can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have yielded yourselves to become subjects to the devil?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments stained with blood and all manner of filthiness?  Behold, what will these things testify against you?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and also that ye are guilty of all manner of wickedness?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose garments are cleansed and are spotless, pure and white?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the children of the kingdom of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble?  That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Behold, are ye stripped of pride?  I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God.  Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy?  I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent, for the Lord God hath spoken it!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life freely;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth not good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye?  Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this?  Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the holy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been spoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And this is not all.  Do ye not suppose that I know of these things myself?  Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true.  And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God.  Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself.  And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto me, that the words which have been spoken by our fathers are true, even so according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me, which is also by the manifestation of the Spirit of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall say unto you, concerning that which is to come, is true; and I say unto you, that I know that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy, and truth.  And behold, it is he that cometh to take away the sins of the world, yea, the sins of every man who steadfastly believeth on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I am called, yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and every one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God cometh in his glory, in his might, majesty, power, and dominion.  Yea, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit saith: Behold the glory of the King of all the earth; and also the King of heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a mighty voice, saying: Go forth and say unto this people&#x2014;Repent, for except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of heaven.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is laid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire.  Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and trample the Holy One under your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing of costly apparel and setting your hearts upon the vain things of the world, upon your riches?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than another; yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your brethren, who humble themselves and do walk after the holy order of God, wherewith they have been brought into this church, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth works which are meet for repentance&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.55" class=""><span class="verse">55</span> Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the poor, and the needy, and in withholding your substance from them?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.56" class=""><span class="verse">56</span> And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I say unto you that these are they who shall be hewn down and cast into the fire except they speedily repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.57" class=""><span class="verse">57</span> And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold, their names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the righteous, that the word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.58" class=""><span class="verse">58</span> For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand.  And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this?  I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.59" class=""><span class="verse">59</span> For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock?  And behold, if a wolf enter his flock doth he not drive him out?  Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.60" class=""><span class="verse">60</span> And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you; and if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you into his fold, and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may not be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.61" class=""><span class="verse">61</span> And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_29.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now when Mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the land, among all the people, desiring to know their will concerning who should be their king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: We are desirous that Aaron thy son should be our king and our ruler.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the sons of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the people; yea, even a written word sent he among the people.  And these were the words that were written, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren, for I esteem you as such, I desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are called to consider&#x2014;for ye are desirous to have a king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now I declare unto you that he to whom the kingdom doth rightly belong has declined, and will not take upon him the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now if there should be another appointed in his stead, behold I fear there would rise contentions among you.  And who knoweth but what my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn to be angry and draw away a part of this people after him, which would cause wars and contentions among you, which would be the cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the Lord, yea, and destroy the souls of many people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider these things, for we have no right to destroy my son, neither should we have any right to destroy another if he should be appointed in his stead.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to commit much sin.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now let us be wise and look forward to these things, and do that which will make for the peace of this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore I will be your king the remainder of my days; nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this people according to our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of this people, for we will appoint wise men to be judges, that will judge this people according to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now it is better that a man should be judged of God than of man, for the judgments of God are always just, but the judgments of man are not always just.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore, if it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings, who would establish the laws of God, and judge this people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did for this people&#x2014;I say unto you, if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And even I myself have labored with all the power and faculties which I have possessed, to teach you the commandments of God, and to establish peace throughout the land, that there should be no wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering, nor murdering, nor any manner of iniquity;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have I punished according to the crime which he has committed, according to the law which has been given to us by our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is not expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked king cause to be committed, yea, and what great destruction!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations, and also the wickedness and abominations of his people.  Behold what great destruction did come upon them; and also because of their iniquities they were brought into bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And were it not for the interposition of their all-wise Creator, and this because of their sincere repentance, they must unavoidably remain in bondage until now.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And behold, now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous king save it be through much contention, and the shedding of much blood.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> For behold, he has his friends in iniquity, and he keepeth his guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned in righteousness before him; and he trampleth under his feet the commandments of God;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his people, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now behold I say unto you, it is not expedient that such abominations should come upon you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers, which are correct, and which were given them by the hand of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law&#x2014;to do your business by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher judge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord; and I command you to do these things, and that ye have no king; that if these people commit sins and iniquities they shall be answered upon their own heads.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For behold I say unto you, the sins of many people have been caused by the iniquities of their kings; therefore their iniquities are answered upon the heads of their kings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now I desire that this inequality should be no more in this land, especially among this my people; but I desire that this land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we may live and inherit the land, yea, even as long as any of our posterity remains upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them, unfolding unto them all the trials and troubles of a righteous king, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also all the murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained it all unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And he told them that these things ought not to be; but that the burden should come upon all the people, that every man might bear his part.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And he also unfolded unto them all the disadvantages they labored under, by having an unrighteous king to rule over them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Yea, all his iniquities and abominations, and all the wars, and contentions, and bloodshed, and the stealing, and the plundering, and the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of iniquities which cannot be enumerated&#x2014;telling them that these things ought not to be, that they were expressly repugnant to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had sent these things forth among the people they were convinced of the truth of his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Therefore they relinquished their desires for a king, and became exceedingly anxious that every man should have an equal chance throughout all the land; yea, and every man expressed a willingness to answer for his own sins.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Therefore, it came to pass that they assembled themselves together in bodies throughout the land, to cast in their voices concerning who should be their judges, to judge them according to the law which had been given them; and they were exceedingly rejoiced because of the liberty which had been granted unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon him as a tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre which doth corrupt the soul; for he had not exacted riches of them, neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but he had established peace in the land, and he had granted unto his people that they should be delivered from all manner of bondage; therefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And it came to pass that they did appoint judges to rule over them, or to judge them according to the law; and this they did throughout all the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the first chief judge, he being also the high priest, his father having conferred the office upon him, and having given him the charge concerning all the affairs of the church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the ways of the Lord, and he did keep his commandments, and he did judge righteous judgments; and there was continual peace through the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> And thus commenced the reign of the judges throughout all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who were called the Nephites; and Alma was the first and chief judge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And now it came to pass that his father died, being eighty and two years old, having lived to fulfil the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And it came to pass that Mosiah died also, in the thirty and third year of his reign, being sixty and three years old; making in the whole, five hundred and nine years from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_29.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> And thus ended the reign of the kings over the people of Nephi; and thus ended the days of Alma, who was the founder of their church.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor wars in the land of Zarahemla;</li>
            <li id="alma_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized.  And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly apparel.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to those who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting themselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their backs upon the needy and the naked and those who were hungry, and those who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people, while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner of afflictions, for Christ&#x2019;s sake, who should come according to the spirit of prophecy;</li>
            <li id="alma_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of their sins; being filled with great joy because of the resurrection of the dead, according to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all their inequality, began to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now this man&#x2019;s name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy.</li>

            <li id="alma_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much business that I could not come unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that the judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea, hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that they are established again in the way of his righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading through much affliction and sorrow.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the true and the living God, and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all&#x2014;for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case.  Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying&#x2014;Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things?  Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the way that I know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of the Spirit which is in me.  And now because your faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken, great is my joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found that my desires have been gratified.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that ye are making his paths straight.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of his word, that he cannot walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal round.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can filthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is filthy shall remain in his filthiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have been received.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the holy prophets who have been ever since the world began, having your garments spotless even as their garments are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no more out.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto you according to the Spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul doth exceedingly rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and heed which ye have given unto my word.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess, your women and your children, according to your faith and good works, from this time forth and forever.  And thus I have spoken.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites who were not slain by the weapons of war, after having buried those who had been slain&#x2014;now the number of the slain were not numbered, because of the greatness of their number&#x2014;after they had finished burying their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses, and their wives, and their children.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and also many of their flocks and their herds; and also many of their fields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the hosts of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had been slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the waters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the sea, and they are many.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And the Amlicites were distinguished from the Nephites, for they had marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the manner of the Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like unto the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites was called under that head, and there was a mark set upon him.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the tradition of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition of their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the commandments of God and kept them, were called the Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time forth&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it is they who have kept the records which are true of their people, and also of the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a mark set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a mark of red upon their foreheads.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against thee and thy seed.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be called thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be called thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the promises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the words of God when they began to mark themselves in their foreheads; nevertheless they had come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should fall upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own condemnation.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army met the Amlicites.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them out of their land.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up to battle at this time against the Lamanites;</li>
            <li id="alma_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and slew many of the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them out of the borders of their land.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And then they returned again and began to establish peace in the land, being troubled no more for a time with their enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and contentions were commenced and ended in the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards according to their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one.</li>
            <li id="alma_3.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this according to the words of the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according to the truth.  And thus endeth the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</li>

            <li id="alma_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church who repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance, and were received into the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not repent of their wickedness and humble themselves before God&#x2014;I mean those who were lifted up in the pride of their hearts&#x2014;the same were rejected, and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the city of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was liberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of assembling themselves together to hear the word of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather themselves together oft, and join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church which was established in the valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and the holy order by which he was called.  And thus it is written.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the order of the church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself from the labors which he had performed.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek according to the holy order of God, by which he had been called; and he began to teach the people throughout all the land of Melek.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all the borders of the land which was by the wilderness side. And they were baptized throughout all the land;</li>
            <li id="alma_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and traveled three days&#x2019; journey on the north of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of Ammonihah he began to preach the word of God unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which was called Aaron.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from him.  Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them.  Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will destroy them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has given unto his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah.  And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?</li>
            <li id="alma_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive.  Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this land forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them concerning their iniquities.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many days.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their iniquities.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people, saying&#x2014;Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and cast into prison.  Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had given them.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was that same Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the hands of his brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power.  I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house.  And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house&#x2014;and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices&#x2014;yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come down among my people, with equity and justice in my hands.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts?  Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, according to their truth?</li>
            <li id="alma_10.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For behold, have I testified against your law?  Ye do not understand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law.  And now he says that he has not spoken against it.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things against him.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom.  Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their employ.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should receive wages according to the time which they labored to judge those who were brought before them to be judged.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he did owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the judge received for his wages according to his time&#x2014;a senine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold; and this is according to the law which was given.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold, and of their silver, according to their value.  And the names are given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges, they having been established by king Mosiah.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now the reckoning is thus&#x2014;a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either for a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of grain.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And an onti was as great as them all.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a measure of barley.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And a leah is the half of a shiblum.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they received their wages according to their employ, therefore, they did stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ, that they might get money according to the suits which were brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I shall ask you?  Now Zeezrom was a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord.  And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me?  Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Believest thou that there is no God?  I say unto you, Nay, thou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more than him.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now thou hast lied before God unto me.  Thou saidst unto me&#x2014;Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto thee&#x2014;when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true and living God, that thou mightest have cause to destroy me.  And now behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy reward.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living God?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And he answered, No.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these things?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come?  Is it the Son of God?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And he said unto him, Yea.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins?  And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people&#x2014;as though he had authority to command God.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he shall not save his people in their sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven?  Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;</li>
            <li id="alma_11.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body.  I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble.  And thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have written.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And this is the manner after which they were ordained&#x2014;being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world for such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter into his rest&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of all things&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now they were ordained after this manner&#x2014;being called with a holy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and high priesthood, is without beginning or end&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is.  Amen.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood, there were many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were sanctified, and their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and there were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before God, and bring forth fruit meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into that rest.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek, who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people.  And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now, there were many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but none were greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made mention.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice.  Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest them it shall be to your own destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words unto them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a mighty voice, saying: Now is the time to repent, for the day of salvation draweth nigh;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And they are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we know not how soon.  Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it shall be made known unto just and holy men, by the mouth of angels, at the time of his coming, that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled, according to that which they have spoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by the chains of hell, that ye may not suffer the second death.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not written in this book.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 12</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his lying and deceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble under a consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that which Amulek had done.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the people round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on this wise:</li>
            <li id="alma_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this people that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us out&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee.  Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto thee I say unto all.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God.  And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be judged according to their works?</li>
            <li id="alma_12.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction.  Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being brought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our works.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God&#x2019;s justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking these words, the people began to be more astonished;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, came forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an immortal state, that the soul can never die?</li>
            <li id="alma_12.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever?  And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to explain.  Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would have been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none effect.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto them;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first transgressed the first commandments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme goodness of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being the plan of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will harden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his wrath upon you as in the first provocation, yea, according to his word in the last provocation as well as the first, to the everlasting destruction of your souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the last death, as well as the first.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us in these his second commandments which he has given unto us; but let us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared according to his word.</li>

            <li id="alma_14.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass after he had made an end of speaking unto the people many of them did believe on his words, and began to repent, and to search the scriptures.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the plainness of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had lied unto them, and had reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they had testified so plainly against their wickedness, they sought to put them away privily.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and bound them with strong cords, and took them before the chief judge of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the people went forth and witnessed against them&#x2014;testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should not save them; and many such things did the people testify against Alma and Amulek.  Now this was done before the chief judge of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his lying words; and his soul began to be harrowed up under a consciousness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the pains of hell.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that he began to cry unto the people, saying: Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before God.  And he began to plead for them from that time forth; but they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil?  And they spit upon him, and cast him out from among them, and also all those who believed in the words which had been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at them.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire; and they also brought forth their records which contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be burned and destroyed by fire.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene?  Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they will burn us also.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord.  But, behold, our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had been cast into the fire were consumed, and also the records which were cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon their cheeks, and said unto them: After what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone?</li>
            <li id="alma_14.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith.  And the judge smote them again upon their cheeks, and asked: What say ye for yourselves?</li>
            <li id="alma_14.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew Gideon.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him nothing; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And when they had been cast into prison three days, there came many lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the prison to see them, and they questioned them about many words; but they answered them nothing.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why do ye not answer the words of this people?  Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames?  And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks.  And many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn our law?  If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver yourselves?</li>
            <li id="alma_14.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we look when we are damned?</li>
            <li id="alma_14.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days.  And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound with strong cords, and confined in prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of their teachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison where Alma and Amulek were bound with cords.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again, and said unto them: If ye have the power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people according to your words.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O Lord?  O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance.  And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power, according to their faith which was in Christ.  And they straightway came forth out of the prison; and they were loosed from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and every soul within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now the people having heard a great noise came running together by multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek coming forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had fallen to the earth, they were struck with great fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even as a goat fleeth with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee from the presence of Alma and Amulek.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 15</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to depart out of that city; and they departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found all the people who had departed out of the land of Ammonihah, who had been cast out and stoned, because they believed in the words of Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they related unto them all that had happened unto their wives and children, and also concerning themselves, and of their power of deliverance.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which was caused by the great tribulations of his mind on account of his wickedness, for he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no more; and he supposed that they had been slain because of his iniquity.  And this great sin, and his many other sins, did harrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having no deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning heat.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of Sidom, his heart began to take courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the message which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the house unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed, sick, being very low with a burning fever; and his mind also was exceedingly sore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand: Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?</li>
            <li id="alma_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the words that thou hast taught.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And Alma said: If thou believest in the redemption of Christ thou canst be healed.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he said: Yea, I believe according to thy words.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have mercy on this man, and heal him according to his faith which is in Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom leaped upon his feet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great astonishment of all the people; and the knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land of Sidom.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from that time forth to preach unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and consecrated priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the Lord whosoever were desirous to be baptized.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock in from all the region round about Sidom, and were baptized.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of Nehor, and did not believe in the repentance of their sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having forsaken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which were in the land of Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being rejected by those who were once his friends and also by his father and his kindred;</li>
            <li id="alma_15.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom, seeing a great check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as to the pride of their hearts, and began to humble themselves before God, and began to assemble themselves together at their sanctuaries to worship God before the altar, watching and praying continually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and from death, and from destruction&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_15.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore he took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_16.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there having been much peace in the land of Zarahemla, there having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of years, even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the wilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city of Ammonihah, and began to slay the people and destroy the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a sufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had destroyed the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, and also some around the borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain those who had been carried away captive into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi and Aha)&#x2014;now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was high priest over the church, and having heard that he had the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went unto him and desired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go into the wilderness in search of their brethren, who had been taken captive by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning the matter.  And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the Lamanites will cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up beyond the borders of the land of Manti.  And behold there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon, and there the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren who have been taken captive by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the river Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond the borders of Manti into the south wilderness, which was on the east side of the river Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren who had been taken captive by the Lamanites, and there was not one soul of them had been lost that were taken captive.  And they were brought by their brethren to possess their own lands.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites having been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites was destroyed, and also their great city, which they said God could not destroy, because of its greatness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But behold, in one day it was left desolate; and the carcasses were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, after many days their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering.  And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.  And it was called Desolation of Nehors; for they were of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands remained desolate.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.  And thus for three years did the people of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart the word of God, without any respect of persons, continually.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who had been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all the land.  And the establishment of the church became general throughout the land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there was no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out his Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of the children of men, or to prepare their hearts to receive the word which should be taught among them at the time of his coming&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_16.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> That they might not be hardened against the word, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they might receive the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true vine, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now those priests who did go forth among the people did preach against all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering, murdering, committing adultery, and all manner of lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_16.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding forth the coming of the Son of God, his sufferings and death, and also the resurrection of the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would appear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now after the church had been established throughout all the land&#x2014;having got the victory over the devil, and the word of God being preached in its purity in all the land, and the Lord pouring out his blessings upon the people&#x2014;thus ended the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

<p data-aid="154069203" id="p1">Some might see King Mosiah&#x2019;s proposal to replace kings with elected judges as merely wise political reform. But to the Nephites, especially those who lived under wicked King Noah, this change had spiritual significance too. They had seen how an unrighteous king had influenced his people, and they were &#x201C;exceedingly anxious&#x201D; to be free from such influence. This change would allow them to be responsible for their own righteousness and &#x201C;answer for [their] own sins&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&amp;id=p38#p38">Mosiah 29:38</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154069209" id="p2">Of course, the end of the reign of kings did not mean the end of problems in Nephite society. Cunning people like Nehor and Amlici promoted false ideas, nonbelievers persecuted the Saints, and many members of the Church became prideful and fell away. Yet &#x201C;the humble followers of God&#x201D; remained &#x201C;steadfast and immovable&#x201D; despite what happened around them (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15">Alma 4:15</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p25#p25">1:25</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154069232" id="p3">Just five years into the reign of the judges, a crisis arose that would test Mosiah&#x2019;s declaration that the voice of the people would usually choose what was right (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&amp;id=p26#p26">Mosiah 29:26</a>). Study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p7#p1">Alma 2:1&#x2013;7</a> to find out what the issue was and what the Nephites did about it. What might have happened if &#x201C;the people of the church&#x201D; had not made their voices heard? What else do you learn from this account about how the Lord wants you to be involved in your community? (see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&amp;id=p26-p27#p26">Mosiah 29:26&#x2013;27</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154069238" id="p4">What are the important issues facing your community?

<p data-aid="154069263" id="p6">Although Nehor eventually confessed that what he taught was false, his teachings continued to influence the Nephites for many years.

<p data-aid="154070741" id="p1">After nearly three generations of living in separate lands, the Nephites were one people again. Limhi&#x2019;s people, Alma&#x2019;s people, and Mosiah&#x2019;s people&#x2014;even the people of Zarahemla, who were not descended from Nephi&#x2014;were now all &#x201C;numbered with the Nephites&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/25?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">Mosiah 25:13</a>). Many of them also wanted to become members of the Lord&#x2019;s Church, as Alma&#x2019;s people had. So all those who &#x201C;were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ&#x201D; were baptized, &#x201C;and they were called the people of God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/25?lang=eng&amp;id=p23-p24#p23">Mosiah 25:23&#x2013;24</a>). After years of conflict and captivity, it seemed that the Nephites would finally enjoy a period of peace.</p>
<p data-aid="154070749" id="p2">But before long, unbelievers began persecuting the Saints. What made this especially heartbreaking was that many of these unbelievers were the believers&#x2019; own children&#x2014;the &#x201C;rising generation&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26?lang=eng&amp;id=p1#p1">Mosiah 26:1</a>), including the sons of Mosiah and one son of Alma. The account tells of a miraculous visit of an angel. But the true miracle of this story is not just about angels appearing to wayward sons. Conversion is a miracle that, in one way or another, needs to happen in all of us.</p>

<p data-aid="154070815" id="p4">Sometimes we might think that a Church leader like Alma always knows exactly what to do. In <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26?lang=eng">Mosiah&#xA0;26</a> we read of a problem in the Church that Alma had never dealt with. What did Alma do in this situation?

What does Alma&#x2019;s experience suggest about how you might approach difficult problems in your family or your Church service?</p>
<p data-aid="154070825" id="p5">What did the Lord teach Alma in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p32#p15">Mosiah 26:15&#x2013;32</a>? Notice that some of the Lord&#x2019;s answers were not in direct response to Alma&#x2019;s question. What does this suggest about prayer and receiving personal revelation?</p>

<p data-aid="154070893" id="p8">It was obvious that Alma the Younger needed a spiritual rebirth. He and the sons of Mosiah were &#x201C;the very vilest of sinners&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28?lang=eng&amp;id=p4#p4">Mosiah 28:4</a>). But soon after his conversion, Alma testified that conversion is essential&#x2014;for everyone: &#x201C;Marvel not,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;that <em>all</em> mankind &#x2026; must be born again&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p25#p25">Mosiah 27:25</a>; emphasis added).</p>
<p data-aid="154070899" id="p9">As you read about Alma&#x2019;s experience in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p8-p37#p8">Mosiah 27:8&#x2013;37</a>, consider putting yourself in his story. Can you think of things about yourself that need to change? Who, like Alma&#x2019;s father, might be praying for you &#x201C;with much faith&#x201D;? What experiences have helped &#x201C;convince [you] of the power and authority of God&#x201D;? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p14#p14">Mosiah 27:14</a>). What &#x201C;great things&#x201D; has the Lord done for you or your family that you should &#x201C;remember&#x201D;? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16">Mosiah 27:16</a>). What do you learn from Alma the Younger&#x2019;s words and actions about what it means to be born again? What examples have you seen?</p>
<p data-aid="154070905" id="p10">Take a moment to record some of the ways the Savior is helping you change&#x2014;or be born again&#x2014;even if your experiences aren&#x2019;t as dramatic or as sudden as Alma&#x2019;s. Is there a hymn you could sing or listen to that expresses your feelings, like &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/i-stand-all-amazed?lang=eng">I Stand All Amazed</a>&#x201D;? (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;193). Who might benefit from hearing about your experiences?</p>
<p data-aid="154070911" id="p11">Elder David&#xA0;A. Bednar compared being born again to the process of a cucumber becoming a pickle (see &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2007/04/ye-must-be-born-again?lang=eng">Ye Must Be Born Again</a>,&#x201D; <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, May 2007, 19&#x2013;22). What does this comparison teach you about conversion?</p>

<p data-aid="154069217" id="p1">God&#x2019;s work will not fail. But our efforts to help with His work sometimes seem to fail&#x2014;at least, we may not immediately see the outcomes we hope for. We might feel a little like Alma when he preached the gospel in Ammonihah&#x2014;rejected, spit on, and cast out. Yet when an angel instructed him to go back and try again, Alma courageously &#x201C;returned speedily&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&amp;id=p18#p18">Alma 8:18</a>), and God prepared the way before him. Not only did He provide Alma with food to eat and a place to stay, but He also prepared Amulek, who became a fellow laborer, a fierce defender of the gospel, and a faithful friend. When we face setbacks and disappointments as we serve in the Lord&#x2019;s kingdom, we can remember how God supported and led Alma, and we can trust that God will support and lead us too, even in difficult circumstances.</p>

<p data-aid="154069426" id="p24">This week&#x2019;s activity page could help you summarize the events in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng">Alma 8&#x2013;10</a> for your children. You might want to help them find principles that made Alma and Amulek good missionaries. For example, they didn&#x2019;t give up (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&amp;id=p8-p13#p8">Alma 8:8&#x2013;13</a>), they testified of Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&amp;id=p26-p27#p26">Alma 9:26&#x2013;27</a>), and they worked together (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12">Alma 10:12</a>).</p>

Invite them to list ideas they find and people they could share the gospel with. You might even let them role-play what they might say or do.</p>

<p data-aid="154069412" id="figure2_p1"><strong>Encourage participation.</strong> As you prepare to teach, rather than planning things to say, ask yourself, &#x201C;What will the <em>children do</em> to learn?&#x201D; Children will learn better and remember longer when they actively participate.</p>

<p data-aid="154069440" id="p28">Maybe you could make a friendship puzzle: find or draw a picture representing friendship and cut it into puzzle pieces.

<p data-aid="154069210" id="p1">Alma did not know about today&#x2019;s lifesaving heart transplant surgeries, which replace a damaged or diseased heart with a healthy one.

Alma could see that this change of heart was exactly what many of the Nephites needed. Some were rich and others poor, some prideful and others humble, some persecutors and others afflicted by persecution (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p15#p6">Alma 4:6&#x2013;15</a>). But all of them needed to come unto Jesus Christ to be healed&#x2014;just as we all do. Whether we are seeking to overcome pride or to endure afflictions, Alma&#x2019;s message is the same: &#x201C;Come and fear not&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15">Alma 7:15</a>). Let the Savior change a hardened, sinful, or wounded heart into one that is humble, pure, and new.</p>

<p data-aid="154069309" id="p7">Have you ever felt that no one understands your struggles or challenges? If so, the truths Alma taught can help. As you read, reflect on what these verses teach about the purposes of the Savior&#x2019;s sacrifice. You might make a chart with the headings <i>What the Savior suffered</i> and <i>Why He suffered</i> and list what you find in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p7-p16#p7">Alma 7:7&#x2013;16</a> (see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/isa/53?lang=eng&amp;id=p3-p5#p3">Isaiah 53:3&#x2013;5</a>). Can you think of specific times He suffered some of these things? Here are some examples from the scriptures: <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p13#p1">Matthew 4:1&#x2013;13</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26?lang=eng&amp;id=p55-p56#p55">26:55&#x2013;56</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p39-p44#p39">27:39&#x2013;44</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/mark/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p43-p46#p43">Mark 14:43&#x2013;46</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/luke/9?lang=eng&amp;id=p58#p58">Luke 9:58</a>.
