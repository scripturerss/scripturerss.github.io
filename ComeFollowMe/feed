            <li id="2 ne_19.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Nevertheless, the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more grievously afflict by the way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Thou hast multiplied the nation, and increased the joy&#x2014;they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Of the increase of government and peace there is no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever.  The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart:</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> The Syrians before and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth.  For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush in one day.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows; for every one of them is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly.  For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For wickedness burneth as the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forests, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall spare his brother.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_19.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; they together shall be against Judah.  For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_24.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the people shall take them and bring them to their place; yea, from far unto the ends of the earth; and they shall return to their lands of promise.  And the house of Israel shall possess them, and the land of the Lord shall be for servants and handmaids; and they shall take them captives unto whom they were captives; and they shall rule over their oppressors.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give thee rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the scepters of the rulers.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet; they break forth into singing.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and also the cedars of Lebanon, saying: Since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> All they shall speak and say unto thee: Art thou also become weak as we?  Art thou become like unto us?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Thy pomp is brought down to the grave; the noise of thy viols is not heard; the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!  Art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For thou hast said in thy heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_24.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of Hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, saying: Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> That I will bring the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot; then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all nations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> For the Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent&#x2019;s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved; for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_24.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> What shall then answer the messengers of the nations?  That the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_26.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And after Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show himself unto you, my children, and my beloved brethren; and the words which he shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye shall do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many generations shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and contentions among my people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them; wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as stubble.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of the earth shall swallow them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; and mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people!  For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways are just.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution&#x2014;behold, they are they which shall not perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But the Son of Righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light, therefore they must go down to hell.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction, and this grieveth my soul.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days; concerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things forth unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them; and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the prayers of the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which shall be done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away&#x2014;yea, thus saith the Lord God: It shall be at an instant, suddenly&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it shall come to pass, that those who have dwindled in unbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there are many churches built up which cause envyings, and strifes, and malice.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God worketh not in darkness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.  Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without price.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the synagogues, or out of the houses of worship?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love.  And except they should have charity they were nothing.  Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_25.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah.  For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the word which he hath spoken.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy.  But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the words unto mine own people; for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last days; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them, immediately after my father left Jerusalem; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those which are carried away captive into Babylon.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now this I speak because of the spirit which is in me. And notwithstanding they have been carried away they shall return again, and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall be restored again to the land of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is laid in a sepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God.  Wherefore, my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the people of his church.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered by other nations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations, yea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which is infinite for all mankind&#x2014;and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with pure hearts and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the day will come that it must needs be expedient that they should believe these things.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state.  Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given them for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which should deceive the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err.  And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be judged of them according to the words which are written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may know the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness of the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ, and know for what end the law was given.  And after the law is fulfilled in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts against him when the law ought to be done away.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people; wherefore, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand.  And the words which I have spoken shall stand as a testimony against you; for they are sufficient to teach any man the right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And, inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the performances and ordinances of God until the law shall be fulfilled which was given unto Moses.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_27.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles&#x2014;yea, behold all the nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those who shall come upon this land and those who shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the earth, behold, they will be drunken with iniquity and all manner of abominations&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise, and with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye shall be drunken but not with wine, ye shall stagger but not with strong drink.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep.  For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have rejected the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of your iniquity.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the words of a book, and they shall be the words of them which have slumbered.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations of the people.  Wherefore the book shall be kept from them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words of the book, which are the words of those who have slumbered in the dust, and he shall deliver these words unto another;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But the words which are sealed he shall not deliver, neither shall he deliver the book.  For the book shall be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for behold, they reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may show them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee.  And the learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, because of the glory of the world and to get gain will they say this, and not for the glory of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is sealed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that is not learned shall say: I am not learned.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Touch not the things which are sealed, for I will bring them forth in mine own due time; for I will show unto the children of men that I am able to do mine own work.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read, until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And again it shall come to pass that the Lord shall say unto him that shall read the words that shall be delivered him:</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord!  And their works are in the dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and who knoweth us?  And they also say: Surely, your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter&#x2019;s clay.  But behold, I will show unto them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that I know all their works.  For shall the work say of him that made it, he made me not?  Or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, he had no understanding?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> But behold, saith the Lord of Hosts: I will show unto the children of men that it is yet a very little while and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field; and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And the meek also shall increase, and their joy shall be in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For assuredly as the Lord liveth they shall see that the terrible one is brought to naught, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And they that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Therefore, thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_29.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> But behold, there shall be many&#x2014;at that day when I shall proceed to do a marvelous work among them, that I may remember my covenants which I have made unto the children of men, that I may set my hand again the second time to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember your seed; and that the words of your seed should proceed forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And because my words shall hiss forth&#x2014;many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible!  A Bible!  We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people.  And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them?  Yea, what do the Gentiles mean?  Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people?  Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them.  But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible.  Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Know ye not that there are more nations than one?  Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word?  Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another?  Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another.  And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words according to mine own pleasure.  And because that I have spoken one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one.  And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you, according as the Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I know that they must surely come to pass.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the things which shall be written out of the book shall be of great worth unto the children of men, and especially unto our seed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am the Lord&#x2019;s; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lord&#x2019;s; and thus shall every one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they shall contend one with another; and their priests shall contend one with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they shall say there is a miracle wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for this day he is not a God of miracles; he hath done his work.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false doctrines, and all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord, wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord God Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell!</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none&#x2014;and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_30.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you; for I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye should suppose that ye are more righteous than the Gentiles shall be.  For behold, except ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall all likewise perish; and because of the words which have been spoken ye need not suppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles.  For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And then shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them; wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a pure and a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to gather in upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe in Christ shall also become a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his work among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration of his people upon the earth.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth.  And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a great division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy; and he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the wicked by fire.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice&#x2019;s den.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time.  And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_31.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren.  And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men.  For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Know ye not that he was holy?  But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me.  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism&#x2014;yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful.  He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter.  For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.  Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.  And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_32.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way.  But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ.  Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh.  And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing.  For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_33.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people.  For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people.  And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the words which I have written save he shall be of the spirit of the devil.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_33.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> I also have charity for the Gentiles.  But behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ.  And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye&#x2014;for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.</li>

<p data-aid="154070292" id="p1">The writings of Isaiah include strong warnings, but they also offer hope and joy. This is one reason Nephi included them in his record: &#x201C;I write some of the words of Isaiah,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;that whoso &#x2026; shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.8?lang=eng#p8">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:8</a>). In a sense, the invitation to read Isaiah&#x2019;s writings is an invitation to rejoice. You can take delight, as Nephi did, in Isaiah&#x2019;s prophecies about the gathering of Israel, the coming of the Messiah, and the peace promised to the righteous. You can rejoice to live in the prophesied day when the Lord has &#x201C;set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/21.12?lang=eng#p12">2&#xA0;Nephi 21:12</a>).

In other words, you can &#x201C;rejoice in Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#p26">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:26</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154070340" id="p3">With all of that in mind, think about the prophecies in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/21?lang=eng">2&#xA0;Nephi 21&#x2013;22</a>. Consider how the Savior is fulfilling these prophecies. What does the prophecy that the wolf will &#x201C;dwell with the lamb&#x201D; mean to you? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/21.6?lang=eng#p6">2&#xA0;Nephi 21:6</a>). Ponder what you can do to be a peacemaker.</p>

<p data-aid="154070390" id="p6">For example, as you read about the &#x201C;ensign&#x201D; (standard or banner) that will be raised to gather God&#x2019;s people, think about how you have seen God gather His people, physically and spiritually. What attracts people to the Lord and His Church?</p>

<p data-aid="154070437" id="p8">The kingdom of Babylon was a mighty political and military threat to ancient Israel. But to Nephi&#x2019;s people&#x2014;and to us today&#x2014;the bigger threat is what Babylon represents: worldliness and sin. Consider how the warnings in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/23?lang=eng">2&#xA0;Nephi 23&#x2013;24</a> might have affected people who feared or admired or trusted Babylon&#x2019;s wealth and power (see, for example <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/23.6-9,11,19-22?lang=eng#p6">23:6&#x2013;9, 11, 19&#x2013;22</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/24.10-19?lang=eng#p10">24:10&#x2013;19</a>).

<p data-aid="154070478" id="p9">Nephi was open about sharing his beliefs&#x2014;especially his testimony of Jesus Christ. Throughout your study of <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng">2&#xA0;Nephi&#xA0;25</a>, think about Nephi&#x2019;s desire to &#x201C;persuade [his] children &#x2026; to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng#p23">verse&#xA0;23</a>). What did Nephi want people to know about the Savior? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.12-13,16?lang=eng#p12">verses 12&#x2013;13,&#xA0;16</a>). How did Nephi try to persuade people to believe in Him? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.19-29?lang=eng#p19">verses 19&#x2013;29</a>). Note passages in this chapter that persuade you to believe in and follow Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="154070499" id="p10">Some of us may not feel as bold as Nephi was about talking of Christ. But maybe you can find something in Nephi&#x2019;s teachings in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23-26?lang=eng#p23">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:23&#x2013;26</a> that inspires you to talk about Him with others more openly. For example, Nephi&#x2019;s declaration &#x201C;We rejoice in Christ&#x201D; might prompt you to think about how the Savior brings you joy&#x2014;and how you can share that joy with others.</p>
<p data-aid="154070514" id="p11">In his message &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2020/10/45andersen?lang=eng">We Talk of Christ</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2020, 88&#x2013;91), Elder Neil&#xA0;L. Andersen suggests how we can speak more openly of Christ in various settings. Which of his suggestions stand out to you? What opportunities do you have to talk of Christ with others?</p>
<p data-aid="154070527" id="p12">What do you feel inspired to tell others about Jesus Christ? If you need some ideas, you might search &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/scriptures/the-living-christ-the-testimony-of-the-apostles/the-living-christ-the-testimony-of-the-apostles?lang=eng">The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles</a>&#x201D; (Gospel Library).

<p data-aid="154070262" id="p1">Engraving on metal plates is not easy, and space on Nephi&#x2019;s small plates was limited. So why would Nephi make the effort of copying so many of the writings of the prophet Isaiah into his record? He did it because he wanted us to believe in Jesus Christ. &#x201C;My soul delighteth,&#x201D; he wrote, &#x201C;in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.4?lang=eng#p4">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:4</a>). Nephi had seen what would happen to his people in future generations. He saw that, despite their great blessings, they would become prideful, contentious, and worldly (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12?lang=eng">1&#xA0;Nephi&#xA0;12</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.4-6?lang=eng#p4">15:4&#x2013;6</a>). He also saw similar problems in our day (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng">1&#xA0;Nephi&#xA0;14</a>). Isaiah&#x2019;s writings warned against such wickedness. But they also gave Nephi hope for a glorious future&#x2014;an end to wickedness, a gathering of the faithful, and &#x201C;great light&#x201D; for people who had &#x201C;walked in darkness&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19.2?lang=eng#p2">2&#xA0;Nephi 19:2</a>). All this would happen because &#x201C;a child [was] born&#x201D; who could end all strife&#x2014;&#x201C;The Prince of Peace&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19.6?lang=eng#p6">2&#xA0;Nephi 19:6</a>).</p>

<h3 data-aid="154070278" id="title3">How can I better understand the teachings of Isaiah?</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154070287" id="p2">Nephi acknowledged that &#x201C;the words of Isaiah are not plain&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.4?lang=eng#p4">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:4</a>). But he also shared ideas to help us find meaning in Isaiah&#x2019;s writings:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154070296" id="p3">&#x201C;<strong>Liken his words unto&#x201D; yourself</strong> (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.2?lang=eng#p2">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:2</a>). Many of Isaiah&#x2019;s teachings have multiple possible meanings and applications. For example, when you read about dwelling places in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/14.5-6?lang=eng#p5">2&#xA0;Nephi 14:5&#x2013;6</a>, consider how these verses apply to your home. Ask yourself, &#x201C;What does Heavenly Father want me to learn?&#x201D;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070305" id="p4"><strong>Look for symbols of Jesus Christ</strong> (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.4?lang=eng#p4">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:4</a>). Many of Isaiah&#x2019;s teachings about the Savior are conveyed through symbols. For example, how is the Savior represented in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19.2?lang=eng#p2">2&#xA0;Nephi 19:2</a>? What does this symbol teach you about Him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070314" id="p5"><strong>Seek to be &#x201C;filled with the spirit of prophecy</strong>&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.4?lang=eng#p4">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:4</a>). As you study, pray for spiritual guidance. You may not understand everything at first, but the Spirit can help you learn what you need to know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154070325" id="p6">You might also find it helpful to refer to the <a href="/study/scriptures/study-helps?lang=eng">study helps</a> in the scriptures, including the footnotes, chapter headings, and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/gs?lang=eng">Guide to the Scriptures</a>. The Book of Mormon and Old Testament institute manuals have additional information that can help you learn about the historical context of Isaiah&#x2019;s teachings.</p>

<p data-aid="154070372" id="p1">Among Nephi&#x2019;s last recorded words, we find this declaration: &#x201C;The Lord commanded me, and I must obey&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.15?lang=eng#p15">2&#xA0;Nephi 33:15</a>). This is a good summary of Nephi&#x2019;s life. He tried to understand the will of God and courageously obeyed it&#x2014;whether that meant risking his life to get the brass plates from Laban, building a boat and crossing the sea, or faithfully teaching the doctrine of Christ with plainness and power. Nephi could speak persuasively of the need to &#x201C;press forward with a steadfastness in Christ,&#x201D; of following the &#x201C;strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20,18?lang=eng#p20">2&#xA0;Nephi 31:20,&#xA0;18</a>), because that is the path he followed. He knew by experience that this path, though demanding at times, is also joyful, and that &#x201C;there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.21?lang=eng#p21">2&#xA0;Nephi 31:21</a>).</p>

In other words, he was writing about our day. And there&#x2019;s reason to be concerned about what he saw: people denying the power and miracles of God; widespread jealousy and conflict. But in addition to these latter-day &#x201C;works of darkness&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.10,22?lang=eng#p10">2&#xA0;Nephi 26:10,&#xA0;22</a>) led by the adversary, Nephi also spoke of &#x201C;a marvelous work and a wonder&#x201D; led by God Himself (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.26?lang=eng#p26">2&#xA0;Nephi 27:26</a>). Central to that work would be a book&#x2014;a book that exposes Satan&#x2019;s lies and gathers the righteous. That book is the Book of Mormon, the marvelous work is the work of the Lord&#x2019;s Church in the latter days, and the wonder is&#x2014;at least in part&#x2014;that God invites all of us, despite our weaknesses, to participate in the gathering.</p>

<p data-aid="154070832" id="p26">Perhaps you can think of an object lesson that will help your children understand what it means to learn &#x201C;line upon line.&#x201D; For example, they could put together a puzzle or build something with blocks, one piece at a time. Or you could teach them a skill step by step, such as tying a bow or drawing a picture. You could then read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p30">2&#xA0;Nephi 28:30</a> and discuss how Heavenly Father teaches us one truth at a time.</p>
