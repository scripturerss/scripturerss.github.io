            <li id="2 ne_32.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way.  But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ.  Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh.  And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing.  For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_29.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> But behold, there shall be many&#x2014;at that day when I shall proceed to do a marvelous work among them, that I may remember my covenants which I have made unto the children of men, that I may set my hand again the second time to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember your seed; and that the words of your seed should proceed forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And because my words shall hiss forth&#x2014;many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible!  A Bible!  We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people.  And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them?  Yea, what do the Gentiles mean?  Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people?  Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them.  But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible.  Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Know ye not that there are more nations than one?  Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word?  Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another?  Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another.  And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words according to mine own pleasure.  And because that I have spoken one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one.  And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.</li>

            <li id="jacob_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart.  Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down justice upon those who seek your destruction.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy this day before God; for except ye repent the land is cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you, nevertheless they are cursed with a sore cursing, shall scourge you even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead away the righteous out from among you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father&#x2014;that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may not become angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second death.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi, warning them against fornication and lasciviousness, and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which now began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these plates; but many of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates, and their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by the hand of Nephi.  And I make an end of speaking these words.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words of the prophet Zenos, which he spake unto the house of Israel, saying:</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the words of me, a prophet of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O house of Israel, like unto a tame olive tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive tree began to decay; and he said: I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish not.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it, and nourished it according to his word.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that after many days it began to put forth somewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the main top thereof began to perish.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it, and he said unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild olive tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off those...</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Take thou the branches of the wild olive tree, and graft them in, in the stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off I will cast into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber the ground of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the vineyard did according to the word of the Lord of the vineyard, and grafted in the branches of the wild olive tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and nourish it, according to my words.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And these will I place in the nethermost part of my vineyard, whithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; and I do it that I may preserve unto myself the natural branches of the tree; and also, that I may lay up fruit thereof against the season, unto myself; for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree and the fruit thereof.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went his way, and hid the natural branches of the tame olive tree in the nethermost parts of the vineyard, some in one and some in another, according to his will and pleasure.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that a long time passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor in the vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and also the servant, went down into the vineyard to labor.  And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Behold, look here; behold the tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and beheld the tree in the which the wild olive branches had been grafted; and it had sprung forth and begun to bear fruit.  And he beheld that it was good; and the fruit thereof was like unto the natural fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And he said unto the servant: Behold, the branches of the wild tree have taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof, that the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and because of the much strength of the root thereof the wild branches have brought forth tame fruit.  Now, if we had not grafted in these branches, the tree thereof would have perished.  And now, behold, I shall lay up much fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought forth; and the fruit thereof I shall lay up against the season, unto mine own self.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Come, let us go to the nethermost part of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches of the tree have not brought forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of the fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that they went forth whither the master had hid the natural branches of the tree, and he said unto the servant: Behold these; and he beheld the first that it had brought forth much fruit; and he beheld also that it was good.  And he said unto the servant: Take of the fruit thereof, and lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self; for behold, said he, this long time have I nourished it, and it hath brought forth much fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: How comest thou hither to plant this tree, or this branch of the tree?  For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him: Counsel me not; I knew that it was a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, I have nourished it this long time, and thou beholdest that it hath brought forth much fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Look hither; behold I have planted another branch of the tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer than the first.  But, behold the tree.  I have nourished it this long time, and it hath brought forth much fruit; therefore, gather it, and lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said again unto his servant: Look hither, and behold another branch also, which I have planted; behold that I have nourished it also, and it hath brought forth fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the last.  Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck off the branches that have not brought forth good fruit, and cast them into the fire.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, the servant said unto him: Let us prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little longer, that perhaps it may bring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up against the season.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant of the Lord of the vineyard did nourish all the fruit of the vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that a long time had passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard.  For behold, the time draweth near, and the end soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own self.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant went down into the vineyard; and they came to the tree whose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches had been grafted in; and behold all sorts of fruit did cumber the tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard did taste of the fruit, every sort according to its number.  And the Lord of the vineyard said: Behold, this long time have we nourished this tree, and I have laid up unto myself against the season much fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But behold, this time it hath brought forth much fruit, and there is none of it which is good.  And behold, there are all kinds of bad fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding all our labor; and now it grieveth me that I should lose this tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: What shall we do unto the tree, that I may preserve again good fruit thereof unto mine own self?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And the servant said unto his master: Behold, because thou didst graft in the branches of the wild olive tree they have nourished the roots, that they are alive and they have not perished; wherefore thou beholdest that they are yet good.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: The tree profiteth me nothing, and the roots thereof profit me nothing so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good, and for mine own purpose I have preserved them; and because of their much strength they have hitherto brought forth, from the wild branches, good fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But behold, the wild branches have grown and have overrun the roots thereof; and because that the wild branches have overcome the roots thereof it hath brought forth much evil fruit; and because that it hath brought forth so much evil fruit thou beholdest that it beginneth to perish; and it will soon become ripened, that it may be cast into the fire, except we should do something for it to preserve it.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches have also brought forth evil fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And it came to pass that they went down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard.  And it came to pass that they beheld that the fruit of the natural branches had become corrupt also; yea, the first and the second and also the last; and they had all become corrupt.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And the wild fruit of the last had overcome that part of the tree which brought forth good fruit, even that the branch had withered away and died.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and said unto the servant: What could I have done more for my vineyard?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it were these, had become corrupted.  And now these which have once brought forth good fruit have also become corrupted; and now all the trees of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to be hewn down and cast into the fire.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And behold this last, whose branch hath withered away, I did plant in a good spot of ground; yea, even that which was choice unto me above all other parts of the land of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> And thou beheldest that I also cut down that which cumbered this spot of ground, that I might plant this tree in the stead thereof.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And thou beheldest that a part thereof brought forth good fruit, and a part thereof brought forth wild fruit; and because I plucked not the branches thereof and cast them into the fire, behold, they have overcome the good branch that it hath withered away.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And now, behold, notwithstanding all the care which we have taken of my vineyard, the trees thereof have become corrupted, that they bring forth no good fruit; and these I had hoped to preserve, to have laid up fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self.  But, behold, they have become like unto the wild olive tree, and they are of no worth but to be hewn down and cast into the fire; and it grieveth me that I should lose them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> But what could I have done more in my vineyard?  Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it?  Nay, I have nourished it, and I have digged about it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost all the day long, and the end draweth nigh.  And it grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire that they should be burned.  Who is it that has corrupted my vineyard?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Is it not the loftiness of thy vineyard&#x2014;have not the branches thereof overcome the roots which are good?  And because the branches have overcome the roots thereof, behold they grew faster than the strength of the roots, taking strength unto themselves.  Behold, I say, is not this the cause that the trees of thy vineyard have become corrupted?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Let us go to and hew down the trees of the vineyard and cast them into the fire, that they shall not cumber the ground of my vineyard, for I have done all.  What could I have done more for my vineyard?</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> But, behold, the servant said unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare it a little longer.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And the Lord said: Yea, I will spare it a little longer, for it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> Wherefore, let us take of the branches of these which I have planted in the nethermost parts of my vineyard, and let us graft them into the tree from whence they came; and let us pluck from the tree those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in the natural branches of the tree in the stead thereof.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> And this will I do that the tree may not perish, that, perhaps, I may preserve unto myself the roots thereof for mine own purpose.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> And, behold, the roots of the natural branches of the tree which I planted whithersoever I would are yet alive; wherefore, that I may preserve them also for mine own purpose, I will take of the branches of this tree, and I will graft them in unto them. Yea, I will graft in unto them the branches of their mother tree, that I may preserve the roots also unto mine own self, that when they shall be sufficiently strong perhaps they may bring forth good fruit unto me, and I may yet have glory in the fruit of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.55" class=""><span class="verse">55</span> And it came to pass that they took from the natural tree which had become wild, and grafted in unto the natural trees, which also had become wild.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.56" class=""><span class="verse">56</span> And they also took of the natural trees which had become wild, and grafted into their mother tree.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.57" class=""><span class="verse">57</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck not the wild branches from the trees, save it be those which are most bitter; and in them ye shall graft according to that which I have said.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.58" class=""><span class="verse">58</span> And we will nourish again the trees of the vineyard, and we will trim up the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the trees those branches which are ripened, that must perish, and cast them into the fire.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.59" class=""><span class="verse">59</span> And this I do that, perhaps, the roots thereof may take strength because of their goodness; and because of the change of the branches, that the good may overcome the evil.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.60" class=""><span class="verse">60</span> And because that I have preserved the natural branches and the roots thereof, and that I have grafted in the natural branches again into their mother tree, and have preserved the roots of their mother tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my vineyard may bring forth again good fruit; and that I may have joy again in the fruit of my vineyard, and, perhaps, that I may rejoice exceedingly that I have preserved the roots and the branches of the first fruit&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.61" class=""><span class="verse">61</span> Wherefore, go to, and call servants, that we may labor diligently with our might in the vineyard, that we may prepare the way, that I may bring forth again the natural fruit, which natural fruit is good and the most precious above all other fruit.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.62" class=""><span class="verse">62</span> Wherefore, let us go to and labor with our might this last time, for behold the end draweth nigh, and this is for the last time that I shall prune my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.63" class=""><span class="verse">63</span> Graft in the branches; begin at the last that they may be first, and that the first may be last, and dig about the trees, both old and young, the first and the last; and the last and the first, that all may be nourished once again for the last time.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.64" class=""><span class="verse">64</span> Wherefore, dig about them, and prune them, and dung them once more, for the last time, for the end draweth nigh.  And if it be so that these last grafts shall grow, and bring forth the natural fruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that they may grow.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.65" class=""><span class="verse">65</span> And as they begin to grow ye shall clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the good and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad thereof all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.66" class=""><span class="verse">66</span> For it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard; wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the good shall grow, that the root and the top may be equal in strength, until the good shall overcome the bad, and the bad be hewn down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not the ground of my vineyard; and thus will I sweep away the bad out of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.67" class=""><span class="verse">67</span> And the branches of the natural tree will I graft in again into the natural tree;</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.68" class=""><span class="verse">68</span> And the branches of the natural tree will I graft into the natural branches of the tree; and thus will I bring them together again, that they shall bring forth the natural fruit, and they shall be one.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.69" class=""><span class="verse">69</span> And the bad shall be cast away, yea, even out of all the land of my vineyard; for behold, only this once will I prune my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.70" class=""><span class="verse">70</span> And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other servants; and they were few.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.71" class=""><span class="verse">71</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might.  For behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.72" class=""><span class="verse">72</span> And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.73" class=""><span class="verse">73</span> And there began to be the natural fruit again in the vineyard; and the natural branches began to grow and thrive exceedingly; and the wild branches began to be plucked off and to be cast away; and they did keep the root and the top thereof equal, according to the strength thereof.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.74" class=""><span class="verse">74</span> And thus they labored, with all diligence, according to the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard, even until the bad had been cast away out of the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved unto himself that the trees had become again the natural fruit; and they became like unto one body; and the fruits were equal; and the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto himself the natural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the beginning.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.75" class=""><span class="verse">75</span> And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more corrupt, he called up his servants, and said unto them: Behold, for this last time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have preserved the natural fruit, that it is good, even like as it was in the beginning.  And blessed art thou; for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and have brought unto me again the natural fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away, behold ye shall have joy with me because of the fruit of my vineyard.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.76" class=""><span class="verse">76</span> For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard unto mine own self against the season, which speedily cometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I will lay up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to that which I have spoken.</li>
            <li id="jacob_5.77" class=""><span class="verse">77</span> And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my vineyard, then will I cause the good and the bad to be gathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast away into its own place.  And then cometh the season and the end; and my vineyard will I cause to be burned with fire.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> The words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi, spake unto the people of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, and that I might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you the word of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been diligent in the office of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with much more desire and anxiety for the welfare of your souls than I have hitherto been.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the Lord, which I have given unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth I can tell you concerning your thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in sin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and abominable unto God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame before the presence of my Maker, that I must testify unto you concerning the wickedness of your hearts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And also it grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech concerning you, before your wives and your children, many of whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate before God, which thing is pleasing unto God;</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the pleasing word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded soul.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained, because of the strict commandment which I have received from God, to admonish you according to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds of those who are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing their wounds; and those who have not been wounded, instead of feasting upon the pleasing word of God have daggers placed to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do according to the strict commands of God, and tell you concerning your wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in heart, and the broken heart, and under the glance of the piercing eye of the Almighty God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the plainness of the word of God.  For behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying: Jacob, get thou up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall give thee unto this people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare unto you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for silver, and for all manner of precious ores, in the which this land, which is a land of promise unto you and to your seed, doth abound most plentifully.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly, that you have obtained many riches; and because some of you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better than they.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, my brethren, do ye suppose that God justifieth you in this thing?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay.  But he condemneth you, and if ye persist in these things his judgments must speedily come unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> O that he would show you that he can pierce you, and with one glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust!</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> O that he would rid you from this iniquity and abomination.  And, O that ye would listen unto the word of his commands, and let not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls!</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good&#x2014;to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you concerning pride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him because ye were proud in your hearts, of the things which God hath given you, what say ye of it?</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him who created all flesh?  And the one being is as precious in his sight as the other.  And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments and glorify him forever.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this pride.  And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a grosser crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly because of you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes.  For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women.  And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out of the land of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms, like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments were given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them before; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things which ye ought not to have done.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren.  Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you.  And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_30.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles.  For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And then shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them; wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a pure and a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to gather in upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe in Christ shall also become a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his work among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration of his people upon the earth.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth.  And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a great division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy; and he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the wicked by fire.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice&#x2019;s den.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time.  And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.</li>

            <li id="jacob_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you that I would prophesy, behold, this is my prophecy&#x2014;that the things which this prophet Zenos spake, concerning the house of Israel, in the which he likened them unto a tame olive tree, must surely come to pass.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time to recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish and prune his vineyard; and after that the end soon cometh.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And how blessed are they who have labored diligently in his vineyard; and how cursed are they who shall be cast out into their own place!  And the world shall be burned with fire.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the house of Israel, both roots and branches; and he stretches forth his hands unto them all the day long; and they are a stiffnecked and a gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their hearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of soberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of heart, and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you.  And while his arm of mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day, harden not your hearts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; for why will ye die?</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For behold, after ye have been nourished by the good word of God all the day long, will ye bring forth evil fruit, that ye must be hewn down and cast into the fire?</li>

Will ye reject the words of the prophets; and will ye reject all the words which have been spoken concerning Christ, after so many have spoken concerning him; and deny the good word of Christ, and the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit, and make a mock of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid for you?</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Know ye not that if ye will do these things, that the power of the redemption and the resurrection, which is in Christ, will bring you to stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God?</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And according to the power of justice, for justice cannot be denied, ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is endless torment.</li>
            <li id="jacob_6.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> O then, my beloved brethren, repent ye, and enter in at the strait gate, and continue in the way which is narrow, until ye shall obtain eternal life.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass after some years had passed away, there came a man among the people of Nephi, whose name was Sherem.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people, and to declare unto them that there should be no Christ.  And he preached many things which were flattering unto the people; and this he did that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts of the people, insomuch that he did lead away many hearts; and he knowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he sought much opportunity that he might come unto me.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he was learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he could use much flattery, and much power of speech, according to the power of the devil.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many revelations and the many things which I had seen concerning these things; for I truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto me.  And also, I had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the right way of God, and keep not the law of Moses which is the right way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence.  And now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is blasphemy; for no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot tell of things to come.  And after this manner did Sherem contend against me.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, the Lord God poured in his Spirit into my soul, insomuch that I did confound him in all his words.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And I said unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who shall come? And he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever will be.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures?  And he said, Yea.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they truly testify of Christ.  Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And this is not all&#x2014;it has been made manifest unto me, for I have heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should be no atonement made all mankind must be lost.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he said unto me: Show me a sign by this power of the Holy Ghost, in the which ye know so much.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And I said unto him: What am I that I should tempt God to show unto thee a sign in the thing which thou knowest to be true? Yet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the devil.  Nevertheless, not my will be done; but if God shall smite thee, let that be a sign unto thee that he has power, both in heaven and in earth; and also, that Christ shall come.  And thy will, O Lord, be done, and not mine.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that when I, Jacob, had spoken these words, the power of the Lord came upon him, insomuch that he fell to the earth.  And it came to pass that he was nourished for the space of many days.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that he said unto the people: Gather together on the morrow, for I shall die; wherefore, I desire to speak unto the people before I shall die.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were gathered together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied the things which he had taught them, and confessed the Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And he spake plainly unto them, that he had been deceived by the power of the devil.  And he spake of hell, and of eternity, and of eternal punishment.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And he said: I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him.  And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case shall be awful; but I confess unto God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that when he had said these words he could say no more, and he gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And when the multitude had witnessed that he spake these things as he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished exceedingly; insomuch that the power of God came down upon them, and they were overcome that they fell to the earth.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob, for I had requested it of my Father who was in heaven; for he had heard my cry and answered my prayer.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that peace and the love of God was restored again among the people; and they searched the scriptures, and hearkened no more to the words of this wicked man.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that many means were devised to reclaim and restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it all was vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an eternal hatred against us, their brethren.  And they sought by the power of their arms to destroy us continually.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against them with their arms, and with all their might, trusting in the God and rock of their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet, conquerors of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the other plates of Nephi, wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.</li>
            <li id="jacob_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave; wherefore, I said unto my son Enos: Take these plates.  And I told him the things which my brother Nephi had commanded me, and he promised obedience unto the commands.  And I make an end of my writing upon these plates, which writing has been small; and to the reader I bid farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may read my words.  Brethren, adieu.</li>

This is a good summary of Nephi&#x2019;s life. He tried to understand the will of God and courageously obeyed it&#x2014;whether that meant risking his life to get the brass plates from Laban, building a boat and crossing the sea, or faithfully teaching the doctrine of Christ with plainness and power. Nephi could speak persuasively of the need to &#x201C;press forward with a steadfastness in Christ,&#x201D; of following the &#x201C;strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20,18?lang=eng#p20">2&#xA0;Nephi 31:20,&#xA0;18</a>), because that is the path he followed. He knew by experience that this path, though demanding at times, is also joyful, and that &#x201C;there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.21?lang=eng#p21">2&#xA0;Nephi 31:21</a>).</p>

Why does God want us to &#x201C;pray always&#x201D;? Your children could make a list or draw pictures of situations in which they could pray. Then you could sing a song that teaches about prayer, such as &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/did-you-think-to-pray?lang=eng">Did You Think to Pray?</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;140).

            <li id="2 ne_33.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people.  For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people.  And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the words which I have written save he shall be of the spirit of the devil.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.</li>

But behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ.  And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye&#x2014;for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall come.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last day.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must obey.  Amen.</li>

<p data-aid="154070494" id="p1">The Nephites considered Nephi their &#x201C;great protector&#x201D; (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.10?lang=eng#p10">Jacob 1:10</a>). He had also protected them against spiritual dangers, warning them against sin and urging them to come unto Christ. Now that task fell to Jacob, whom Nephi had consecrated to be a priest and teacher (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.18?lang=eng#p18">Jacob 1:18</a>). Jacob felt a responsibility to boldly warn those who were &#x201C;beginning to labor in sin&#x201D; while also comforting &#x201C;the wounded soul&#x201D; of those who had been hurt by the sins of others (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.5-9?lang=eng#p5">Jacob 2:5&#x2013;9</a>). How would he do both? He would point them to Jesus Christ&#x2014;because both groups needed the Savior&#x2019;s healing (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;4</a>). Like the message of Nephi before him, Jacob&#x2019;s testimony was a call to &#x201C;be reconciled unto [God] through the atonement of Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.11?lang=eng#p11">Jacob 4:11</a>).</p>

        <div class="chapterheading"/>
        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 4</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered much unto my people in word, (and I cannot write but a little of my words, because of the difficulty of engraving our words upon plates) and we know that the things which we write upon plates must remain;</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon plates must perish and vanish away; but we can write a few words upon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved brethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or concerning their fathers&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first parents.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his name. And for this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do these things.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord.  How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways.  And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word.  Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand.  For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through the atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things; for why not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the understanding of men; for the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not.  Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls.  But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also spake them unto prophets of old.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they despised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and sought for things that they could not understand.  Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall; for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things which they cannot understand, because they desired it.  And because they desired it God hath done it, that they may stumble.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying; for I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that by the stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they might build and have safe foundation.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But behold, according to the scriptures, this stone shall become the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon which the Jews can build.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that it may become the head of their corner?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this mystery unto you; if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_31.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren.  And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men.  For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Know ye not that he was holy?  But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me.  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism&#x2014;yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful.  He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter.  For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.  Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.  And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end.  Amen.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> For behold, it came to pass that fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates, upon which these things are engraven.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation which was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the heads of them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for Christ&#x2019;s sake, and for the sake of our people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people, what things should happen unto them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ and his kingdom, which should come.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to come unto Christ, and partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die; wherefore, he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now, according to the reigns of the kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> The people having loved Nephi exceedingly, he having been a great protector for them, having wielded the sword of Laban in their defence, and having labored in all his days for their welfare&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name.  And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name they would.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that Nephi died.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solomon, his son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, and they also began to search much gold and silver, and began to be lifted up somewhat in pride.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the Lord.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated priests and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.</li>

<div class="body-block">
<p data-aid="154070471" id="p1">The ancient Apostles were bold in their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His Resurrection (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/acts/4.33?lang=eng#p33">Acts 4:33</a>). Millions of people believe in Jesus Christ and try to follow Him because of their words recorded in the Bible. Yet some people might wonder: If Jesus Christ is the Savior of the whole world, then why were His eyewitnesses limited to a handful of people in one small region?</p>
<p data-aid="154070484" id="p2">The Book of Mormon stands as an additional, convincing witness that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, &#x201C;manifesting himself unto all nations&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng">title page of the Book of Mormon</a>) and offering salvation to all who come unto Him. In addition, this second witness also makes it clear what salvation means. This is why Nephi, Jacob, Mormon, and all the prophets labored so &#x201C;diligently to engraven these words upon plates&#x201D;&#x2014;to declare to future generations that they too &#x201C;knew of Christ, and &#x2026; had a hope of his glory&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.3-4?lang=eng#p3">Jacob 4:3&#x2013;4</a>). This Easter season, reflect on the testimonies in the Book of Mormon that the Savior&#x2019;s power is both universal and personal&#x2014;redeeming the whole world and redeeming you.</p>

<p data-aid="154070521" id="p3">It&#x2019;s traditional at Easter to ponder the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, but what exactly does it mean to be resurrected? What insights does the Book of Mormon offer about resurrection? Perhaps this Easter season you could list truths about resurrection that you find in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.6-15,22?lang=eng#p6">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:6&#x2013;15,&#xA0;22</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.42-45?lang=eng#p42">Alma 11:42&#x2013;45</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.21-25?lang=eng#p21">40:21&#x2013;25</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.4-5?lang=eng#p4">3&#xA0;Nephi 26:4&#x2013;5</a>.</p>
<p data-aid="154070533" id="p4">You could also record how these truths about resurrection influence your actions and the way you live. For example, consider how you would complete these sentences: <i>If I did not know these things&#xA0;&#x2026;</i> and <i>Because I know these things&#xA0;&#x2026;</i></p>
<p data-aid="154070547" id="p5">A hymn like &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/i-know-that-my-redeemer-lives?lang=eng">I Know That My Redeemer Lives</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;136) could help you think about why the Savior&#x2019;s Resurrection is important to you. As you sing, listen to, or read the hymn, you might ask yourself, &#x201C;How is my life different because Jesus Christ was resurrected?&#x201D;</p>
<p data-aid="154070561" id="p6">The Gospel Library has a collection of <a href="/study/video/easter-videos?lang=eng">Easter videos</a> that could be a meaningful part of your study. Perhaps you could watch one or more of these videos and ponder what they add to your understanding or appreciation of the Savior&#x2019;s Resurrection.</p>

<p data-aid="154070601" id="p8">The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ atoned for our sins. The Book of Mormon expands our understanding of Christ&#x2019;s sacrifice and suffering in important ways. You can find some of these teachings in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.7?lang=eng#p7">Mosiah 3:7</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.5-9?lang=eng#p5">15:5&#x2013;9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13?lang=eng#p11">Alma 7:11&#x2013;13</a>. After you read these passages, consider recording what you discover in a chart like this one:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070612" id="p9">What did the Savior suffer?</p>
</th><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070625" id="p10">Why did He suffer?</p>
</th><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070637" id="p11">What does this mean to me?</p>
</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table>
<p data-aid="154070682" id="p12">Here&#x2019;s another way to study these passages: Look for hymns that you feel match the messages they teach. The &#x201C;Scriptures&#x201D; index at the back of the hymnbook can help. What phrases from these hymns and the scriptures help you appreciate the Savior&#x2019;s sacrifice more deeply?</p>

<p data-aid="154070735" id="p14">It could be said that the Book of Mormon is an account of people who changed because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

<p data-aid="154070853" id="p22">The Book of Mormon gives many examples of people who were changed because of the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement. Perhaps your children could choose one to learn about, such as Enos (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.2-8?lang=eng#p2">Enos 1:2&#x2013;8</a>), Alma the Younger (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.8-24?lang=eng#p8">Mosiah 27:8&#x2013;24</a>), or the Anti-Nephi-Lehies (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.7-19?lang=eng#p7">Alma 24:7&#x2013;19</a>). How did this person or group change because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ? How can we follow their examples?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070863" id="p23">You and your children could also compare something clean and something dirty and talk about how dirty things are made clean. Read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.11-13?lang=eng#p11">Alma 13:11&#x2013;13</a>. What did Jesus do so that we can be made clean from our sins? How does this make us feel about sin? How does it make us feel about the Savior?</p>

In other words, he was writing about our day. And there&#x2019;s reason to be concerned about what he saw: people denying the power and miracles of God; widespread jealousy and conflict. But in addition to these latter-day &#x201C;works of darkness&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.10,22?lang=eng#p10">2&#xA0;Nephi 26:10,&#xA0;22</a>) led by the adversary, Nephi also spoke of &#x201C;a marvelous work and a wonder&#x201D; led by God Himself (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.26?lang=eng#p26">2&#xA0;Nephi 27:26</a>). Central to that work would be a book&#x2014;a book that exposes Satan&#x2019;s lies and gathers the righteous. That book is the Book of Mormon, the marvelous work is the work of the Lord&#x2019;s Church in the latter days, and the wonder is&#x2014;at least in part&#x2014;that God invites all of us, despite our weaknesses, to participate in the gathering.</p>
