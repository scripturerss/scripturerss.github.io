            <li id="hel_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the reign of the judges that the contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land among all the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it was this secret band of robbers who did carry on this work of destruction and wickedness.  And this war did last all that year; and in the seventy and third year it did also last.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And so it was done, according to the words of Nephi.  And there was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi.  And thus in the seventy and fourth year the famine did continue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword but became sore by famine.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And this work of destruction did also continue in the seventy and fifth year.  For the earth was smitten that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their God; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the people began to plead with their chief judges and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that the judges did say unto Nephi, according to the words which had been desired.  And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that the people had repented and did humble themselves in sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them insomuch that they have become extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, O Lord, because of this their humility wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in the season of grain.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my words, for thou saidst that: If this people repent I will spare them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the famine and the pestilence and destruction which has come unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they will serve thee?  And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy words which thou hast said.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit.  And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did cover the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west to the sea east.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace.  And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by the prophets.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much strife.  But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain number who were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they became an exceedingly great band of robbers; and they did search out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into the wilderness and upon the mountains to search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> But behold, it came to pass that in that same year they were driven back even into their own lands.  And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first year they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and they were also visited with much destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness and out of the mountains unto their own lands, because of the exceeding greatness of the numbers of those robbers who infested the mountains and the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that thus ended this year.  And the robbers did still increase and wax strong, insomuch that they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come unto the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially their women and their children.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their iniquity, did stir them up again in remembrance of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And thus ended the eighty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And in the eighty and second year they began again to forget the Lord their God.  And in the eighty and third year they began to wax strong in iniquity.  And in the eighty and fourth year they did not mend their ways.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year they did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness; and thus they were ripening again for destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And thus ended the eighty and fifth year.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that in this year there was one Samuel, a Lamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people.  And it came to pass that he did preach, many days, repentance unto the people, and they did cast him out, and he was about to return to his own land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, that he should return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things should come into his heart.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should enter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the wall thereof, and stretched forth his hand and cried with a loud voice, and prophesied unto the people whatsoever things the Lord put into his heart.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, heavy destruction awaiteth this people, and it surely cometh unto this people, and nothing can save this people save it be repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, who surely shall come into the world, and shall suffer many things and shall be slain for his people.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, an angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he did bring glad tidings to my soul.  And behold, I was sent unto you to declare it unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but behold ye would not receive me.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will withdraw my Spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And four hundred years shall not pass away before I will cause that they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword and with famine and with pestilence.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of the fourth generation who shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter destruction; and this shall surely come except ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth generation shall visit your destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord your God I will turn away mine anger, saith the Lord; yea, thus saith the Lord, blessed are they who will repent and turn unto me, but wo unto him that repenteth not.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for behold, it is because of those who are righteous that it is saved; yea, wo unto this great city, for I perceive, saith the Lord, that there are many, yea, even the more part of this great city, that will harden their hearts against me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But blessed are they who will repent, for them will I spare.  But behold, if it were not for the righteous who are in this great city, behold, I would cause that fire should come down out of heaven and destroy it.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, it is for the righteous&#x2019; sake that it is spared.  But behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall cast out the righteous from among you, then shall ye be ripe for destruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of the wickedness and abominations which are in her.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the wickedness and abominations which are in her.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, and wo be unto all the cities which are in the land round about, which are possessed by the Nephites, because of the wickedness and abominations which are in them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And behold, a curse shall come upon the land, saith the Lord of Hosts, because of the people&#x2019;s sake who are upon the land, yea, because of their wickedness and their abominations.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the earth shall find them again no more, because of the great curse of the land, save he be a righteous man and shall hide it up unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their treasures unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up their treasures unto me; for none hideth up their treasures unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasures unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because they have set their hearts upon riches; and because they have set their hearts upon their riches, and will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before their enemies; because they will not hide them up unto me, cursed be they and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my words; yea, hearken unto the words which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye are cursed because of your riches, and also are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon them, and have not hearkened unto the words of him who gave them unto you.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a curse should come upon the land, and also upon your riches, and this because of your iniquities.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arrived, that ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do slay them, and do all manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old time.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of our fathers of old, we would not have slain the prophets; we would not have stoned them, and cast them out.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a sinner, and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth&#x2014;and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he is a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh flattering words unto you, and he saith that all is well, then ye will not find fault with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you?  Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides?  Yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light?</li>
            <li id="hel_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you; behold, he hath cursed the land because of your iniquity.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that they become slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And in the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts.  And then shall ye lament, and say:</li>
            <li id="hel_13.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> O that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out.  Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and behold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought them for battle.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they have slipped away from us, because of the curse of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we cannot hold them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls.  Behold, our iniquities are great.  O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us?  And this shall be your language in those days.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words!  And I pray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be saved.</li>

            <li id="hel_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my beloved brethren, behold, I declare unto you that except ye shall repent your houses shall be left unto you desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to mourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt to flee and there shall be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them which are with child, for they shall be heavy and cannot flee; therefore, they shall be trodden down and shall be left to perish.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, wo unto this people who are called the people of Nephi except they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated because their deeds have been evil continually, and this because of the iniquity of the tradition of their fathers.  But behold, salvation hath come unto them through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their days.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments according to the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they are striving with unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the truth; therefore there are many who do add to their numbers daily.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it, that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war, and they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin; yea, ye can see that they fear to sin&#x2014;for behold they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their enemies, and will not lift their swords against them, and this because of their faith in Christ.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, because of their steadfastness when they do believe in that thing which they do believe, for because of their firmness when they are once enlightened, behold, the Lord shall bless them and prolong their days, notwithstanding their iniquity&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief the Lord shall prolong their days, until the time shall come which hath been spoken of by our fathers, and also by the prophet Zenos, and many other prophets, concerning the restoration of our brethren, the Lamanites, again to the knowledge of the truth&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the promises of the Lord have been extended to our brethren, the Lamanites; and notwithstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and notwithstanding they shall be driven to and fro upon the face of the earth, and be hunted, and shall be smitten and scattered abroad, having no place for refuge, the Lord shall be merciful unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again be brought to the true knowledge, which is the knowledge of their Redeemer, and their great and true shepherd, and be numbered among his sheep.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore I say unto you, it shall be better for them than for you except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, had the mighty works been shown unto them which have been shown unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in unbelief because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see of yourselves that they never would again have dwindled in unbelief.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, saith the Lord: I will not utterly destroy them, but I will cause that in the day of my wisdom they shall return again unto me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the Nephites: If they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I will utterly destroy them, saith the Lord, because of their unbelief notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have done among them; and as surely as the Lord liveth shall these things be, saith the Lord.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that there arose a division among the people, insomuch that they divided hither and thither and went their ways, leaving Nephi alone, as he was standing in the midst of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own house, pondering upon the things which the Lord had shown unto him.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass as he was thus pondering&#x2014;being much cast down because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, their secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of iniquities&#x2014;and it came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came unto him saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people.  And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God.  Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple it shall be rent in twain, it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, if ye shall say that God shall smite this people, it shall come to pass.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now behold, I command you, that ye shall go and declare unto this people, that thus saith the Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except ye repent ye shall be smitten, even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these words unto Nephi, he did stop and did not go unto his own house, but did return unto the multitudes who were scattered about upon the face of the land, and began to declare unto them the word of the Lord which had been spoken unto him, concerning their destruction if they did not repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now behold, notwithstanding that great miracle which Nephi had done in telling them concerning the death of the chief judge, they did harden their hearts and did not hearken unto the words of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Nephi did declare unto them the word of the Lord, saying: Except ye repent, thus saith the Lord, ye shall be smitten even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that when Nephi had declared unto them the word, behold, they did still harden their hearts and would not hearken unto his words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to lay their hands upon him that they might cast him into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not take him to cast him into prison, for he was taken by the Spirit and conveyed away out of the midst of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit, from multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words; and there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided against themselves and began to slay one another with the sword.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

            <li id="hel_14.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a great many more things which cannot be written.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And behold, he said unto them: Behold, I give unto you a sign; for five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all those who shall believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold this is not all, there shall be many signs and wonders in heaven.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it shall come to pass that ye shall all be amazed, and wonder, insomuch that ye shall fall to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the Son of God, the same shall have everlasting life.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the way of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent have I come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judgments of God which do await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of his death.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death&#x2014;that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into the fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost there shall be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall shake and tremble; and the rocks which are upon the face of this earth, which are both above the earth and beneath, which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be found in seams and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth, yea, both above the earth and beneath.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places which are now called valleys which shall become mountains, whose height is great.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And behold, thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space of three days.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of this land, to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</li>

            <li id="hel_16.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city.  And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working miracles among the people, that they might know that the Christ must shortly come&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and remember at the time of their coming that they had been made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing their sins.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus ended also the eighty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges, there were great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the scriptures began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon their own strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot come to pass, of which has been spoken.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to reason and to contend among themselves, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself unto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, why will he not show himself in this land as well as in the land of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield ourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And many more things did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman and his sons.</li>

            <li id="hel_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One&#x2014;yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!</li>
            <li id="hel_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom&#x2019;s paths!</li>
            <li id="hel_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God.</li>

            <li id="hel_12.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And wo unto him to whom he shall say this, for it shall be unto him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this cause, that men might be saved, hath repentance been declared.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Therefore, blessed are they who will repent and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved.</li>

        <div class="chapterheading">Third Nephi<br/>The Book of Nephi<br/><b class="small">The Son of Nephi, Who Was the Son of Helaman</b></div>
        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed away and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief judge and the governor over the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest son, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which had been kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man knoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead, yea, the record of this people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and greater miracles wrought among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath been vain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken might not come to pass.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord all that day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son&#x2014;of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh.  And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day.  And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the words of the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass also that a new star did appear, according to the word.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins.  And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses.  Now in this thing they did err, having not understood the scriptures.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were convinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known unto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass away till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year were they brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess their faults.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come to pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they began to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth year;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of Mosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was given, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come into the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of the records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be found in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had passed away the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction because of this war, which had become exceedingly sore.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites.  And thus ended the thirteenth year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret places.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And thus ended the fourteenth year.  And in the fifteenth year they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many contentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many advantages over them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people in a state of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of their iniquity.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word&#x2014;Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you with utter destruction.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us&#x2014;not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will command that my armies shall come down against you, and they shall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall become extinct.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been handed down unto us.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and government, who have dissented away from you because of your wickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs.  I am Giddianhi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in nowise be delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains over all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great commander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land Desolation.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land.  Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land northward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies.  And Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of every kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of all the holy prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that they must be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come, because of the many signs which had been given, according to the words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and night.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would murder no more were set at liberty.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have those secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against their brethren were condemned and punished according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret, and abominable combinations, in the which there was so much wickedness, and so many murders committed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the twenty and third year also, and the twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and thus had twenty and five years passed away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there had many things transpired which, in the eyes of some, would be great and marvelous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this book; yea, this book cannot contain even a hundredth part of what was done among so many people in the space of twenty and five years;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold there are records which do contain all the proceedings of this people; and a shorter but true account was given by Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore I have made my record of these things according to the record of Nephi, which was engraven on the plates which were called the plates of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their secret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both which were in the land south and which were in the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found that it was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was no way that they could subsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land insomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from before them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain.  And thus was the end of Giddianhi the robber.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did return again to their place of security.  And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in the twentieth year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store,</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the wilderness insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with hunger.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by night, and falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by tens of thousands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, because of the great destruction which came upon them by night and by day.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and march into the furthermost parts of the land northward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of their weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their retreat.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front and in their rear.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in their places of retreat.  And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up prisoners unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were slain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead.  And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing, and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God.  And they did cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a king over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon the judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the people were divided one against another; and they did separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and thus they became tribes and leaders of tribes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much family and many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes became exceedingly great.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they did yield themselves unto the power of Satan.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the regulations of the government were destroyed, because of the secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those who murdered the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch that the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become wicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had given his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes of the people, who were united together save it were their leaders did establish their laws, every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred of those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the government.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people.  And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they were divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders.  But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that Nephi&#x2014;having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds&#x2014;went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book.  And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Thus passed away the thirty and second year also.  And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with water.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a remission of their sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all return to their own lands in the twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and his cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their provisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and they did return to their own lands and their possessions, both on the north and on the south, both on the land northward and on the land southward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and those who had been appointed leaders, who had established this great peace in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and there were many old cities repaired.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had continual peace.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began to be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride and boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers, and many officers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this&#x2014;Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do all manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a few years.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year&#x2014;the people having been delivered up for the space of a long time to be carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should&#x2014;and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel against God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did govern the people that year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent forth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry because of those who testified of these things; and those who were angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been high priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers were angry with those who testified of these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could have power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation was signed by the governor of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now there were many of those who testified of the things pertaining to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put to death secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their death came not unto the governor of the land until after their death.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that any man should be put to death except they had power from the governor of the land&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned the prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up before the judge, to be judged of the crime which they had done, according to the law which had been given by the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and the high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with the kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine against all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord, and enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those who were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be administered according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their country; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the governor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land should no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I caused to be burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, because of their wickedness in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I did send to declare unto them concerning their wickedness and their abominations.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous among them, I did send down fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I sent among them might not cry unto me from the ground against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And many great destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and upon this people, because of their wickedness and their abominations.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did keep the record&#x2014;for he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed away;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the time that there should be darkness for the space of three days over the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among the people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it was about to divide asunder.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had been known in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were drowned.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in the place of the city there became a great mountain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And there was a great and terrible destruction in the land southward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the land northward; for behold, the whole face of the land was changed, because of the tempest and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings and the lightnings, and the exceedingly great quaking of the whole earth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled, and many smooth places became rough.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And many great and notable cities were sunk, and many were burned, and many were shaken till the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain, and the places were left desolate.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And there were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was exceedingly great, and there were many in them who were slain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there were some who were carried away in the whirlwind; and whither they went no man knoweth, save they know that they were carried away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found in broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease&#x2014;for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours&#x2014;and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen could feel the vapor of darkness;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any light at all;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great city Moronihah.  And thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with another, and were showing one to another the great and marvelous change which had taken place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name&#x2014;hear ye him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Hosanna!  Blessed be the name of the Most High God!  And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord and did kiss his feet.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the Lord commanded him that he should arise.  And he arose and stood before him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize.  And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them&#x2014;Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize.  And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> Therefore, go forth unto this people, and declare the words which I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and said unto them: Behold, ye have heard the things which I taught before I ascended to my Father; therefore, whoso remembereth these sayings of mine and doeth them, him will I raise up at the last day.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words he perceived that there were some among them who marveled, and wondered what he would concerning the law of Moses; for they understood not the saying that old things had passed away, and that all things had become new.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he said unto them: Marvel not that I said unto you that old things had passed away, and that all things had become new.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, I say unto you that the law is fulfilled that was given unto Moses.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted with my people Israel; therefore, the law in me is fulfilled, for I have come to fulfil the law; therefore it hath an end.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, I do not destroy the prophets, for as many as have not been fulfilled in me, verily I say unto you, shall all be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And because I said unto you that old things have passed away, I do not destroy that which hath been spoken concerning things which are to come.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For behold, the covenant which I have made with my people is not all fulfilled; but the law which was given unto Moses hath an end in me.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I have given unto you the commandments; therefore keep my commandments.  And this is the law and the prophets, for they truly testified of me.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he said unto those twelve whom he had chosen:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto this people, who are a remnant of the house of Joseph.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_15.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And not at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should tell it unto your brethren at Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Neither at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should tell unto them concerning the other tribes of the house of Israel, whom the Father hath led away out of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> This much did the Father command me, that I should tell unto them:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> That other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now, because of stiffneckedness and unbelief they understood not my word; therefore I was commanded to say no more of the Father concerning this thing unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> But, verily, I say unto you that the Father hath commanded me, and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them because of their iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity that they know not of you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And verily, I say unto you again that the other tribes hath the Father separated from them; and it is because of their iniquity that they know not of them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And they understood me not, for they supposed it had been the Gentiles; for they understood not that the Gentiles should be converted through their preaching.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my voice&#x2014;that I should not manifest myself unto them save it were by the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_15.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> But behold, ye have both heard my voice, and seen me; and ye are my sheep, and ye are numbered among those whom the Father hath given me.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the land did hear these sayings, and did witness of it.  And after these sayings there was silence in the land for the space of many hours;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For so great was the astonishment of the people that they did cease lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain; therefore there was silence in all the land for the space of many hours.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings shall become desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the covenant to your fathers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words, behold, they began to weep and howl again because of the loss of their kindred and friends.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away.  And it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled which had been spoken by the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not carried away in the whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him search them, and see and behold if all these deaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by tempests, and by whirlwinds, and by the opening of the earth to receive them, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of these things at the coming of Christ, and were slain because they testified of these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these things, and also Zenock spake concerning these things, because they testified particularly concerning us, who are the remnant of their seed.</li>

And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph?  And these things which testify of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and fourth year, behold, I will show unto you that the people of Nephi who were spared, and also those who had been called Lamanites, who had been spared, did have great favors shown unto them, and great blessings poured out upon their heads, insomuch that soon after the ascension of Christ into heaven he did truly manifest himself unto them&#x2014;</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Verily, verily, I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet before you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men.  Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the hypocrites, for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.  Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father, who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.  Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he looked upon the twelve whom he had chosen, and said unto them: Remember the words which I have spoken.  For behold, ye are they whom I have chosen to minister unto this people.  Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.  Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.  Are ye not much better than they?</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And why take ye thought for raiment?  Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, even so will he clothe you, if ye are not of little faith.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?  or, What shall we drink?  or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto Nephi, and to those who had been called, (now the number of them who had been called, and received power and authority to baptize, was twelve) and behold, he stretched forth his hand unto the multitude, and cried unto them, saying: Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen from among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them I have given power that they may baptize you with water; and after that ye are baptized with water, behold, I will baptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized, after that ye have seen me and know that I am.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And again, more blessed are they who shall believe in your words because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me, and that ye know that I am.  Yea, blessed are they who shall believe in your words, and come down into the depths of humility and be baptized, for they shall be visited with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And again, blessed are all they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And blessed are all the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my name&#x2019;s sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> For ye shall have great joy and be exceedingly glad, for great shall be your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the salt of the earth; but if the salt shall lose its savor wherewith shall the earth be salted?  The salt shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the light of this people.  A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, do men light a candle and put it under a bushel?  Nay, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets.  I am not come to destroy but to fulfil;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For verily I say unto you, one jot nor one tittle hath not passed away from the law, but in me it hath all been fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, I have given you the law and the commandments of my Father, that ye shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent of your sins, and come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit.  Behold, ye have the commandments before you, and the law is fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Therefore come unto me and be ye saved; for verily I say unto you, that except ye shall keep my commandments, which I have commanded you at this time, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, and it is also written before you, that thou shalt not kill, and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment of God;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of his judgment.  And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Therefore, if ye shall come unto me, or shall desire to come unto me, and rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Go thy way unto thy brother, and first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I will receive you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him, lest at any time he shall get thee, and thou shalt be cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost senine.  And while ye are in prison can ye pay even one senine?  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your heart;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For it is better that ye should deny yourselves of these things, wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye should be cast into hell.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> It hath been written, that whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whoso shall marry her who is divorced committeth adultery.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And again it is written, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> But verily, verily, I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God&#x2019;s throne;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair black or white;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever cometh of more than these is evil.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And behold, it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> But I say unto you, that ye shall not resist evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn thou not away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> But behold I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> Therefore those things which were of old time, which were under the law, in me are all fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> Old things are done away, and all things have become new.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For they of whom I speak are they who have not as yet heard my voice; neither have I at any time manifested myself unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But I have received a commandment of the Father that I shall go unto them, and that they shall hear my voice, and shall be numbered among my sheep, that there may be one fold and one shepherd; therefore I go to show myself unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I command you that ye shall write these sayings after I am gone, that if it so be that my people at Jerusalem, they who have seen me and been with me in my ministry, do not ask the Father in my name, that they may receive a knowledge of you by the Holy Ghost, and also of the other tribes whom they know not of, that these sayings which ye shall write shall be kept and shall be manifested unto the Gentiles, that through the fulness of the Gentiles, the remnant of their seed, who shall be scattered forth upon the face of the earth because of their unbelief, may be brought in, or may be brought to a knowledge of me, their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And then will I gather them in from the four quarters of the earth; and then will I fulfil the covenant which the Father hath made unto all the people of the house of Israel.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles&#x2014;for notwithstanding they have come forth upon the face of this land, and have scattered my people who are of the house of Israel; and my people who are of the house of Israel have been cast out from among them, and have been trodden under feet by them;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And because of the mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles, and also the judgments of the Father upon my people who are of the house of Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, that after all this, and I have caused my people who are of the house of Israel to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to be slain, and to be cast out from among them, and to become hated by them, and to become a hiss and a byword among them&#x2014;</li>

            <li id="3 ne_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And then will I remember my covenant which I have made unto my people, O house of Israel, and I will bring my gospel unto them.</li>
