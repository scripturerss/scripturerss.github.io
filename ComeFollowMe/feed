            <li id="2 ne_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness.  Look unto the rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence ye are digged.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah, she that bare you; for I called him alone, and blessed him.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord.  Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation; for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light for the people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arm shall judge the people.  The isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner.  But my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart I have written my law, fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool.  But my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Awake, awake!  Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the ancient days.  Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness shall be upon their heads; and they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you.  Behold, who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of man, who shall die, and of the son of man, who shall be made like unto grass?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast feared continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy?  And where is the fury of the oppressor?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But I am the Lord thy God, whose waves roared; the Lord of Hosts is my name.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: Behold, thou art my people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury&#x2014;thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling wrung out&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought forth; neither that taketh her by the hand, of all the sons she hath brought up.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> These two sons are come unto thee, who shall be sorry for thee&#x2014;thy desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword&#x2014;and by whom shall I comfort thee?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head of all the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not with wine:</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause of his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over&#x2014;and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I cast thee off forever?  For thus saith the Lord: Where is the bill of your mother&#x2019;s divorcement?  To whom have I put thee away, or to which of my creditors have I sold you?  Yea, to whom have I sold you?  Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I called, yea, there was none to answer.  O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver?  Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make their rivers a wilderness and their fish to stink because the waters are dried up, and they die because of thirst.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O house of Israel.  When ye are weary he waketh morning by morning.  He waketh mine ear to hear as the learned.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair.  I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded.  Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For the Lord God will help me.  And all they who shall condemn me, behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, and the moth shall eat them up.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks which ye have kindled.  This shall ye have of mine hand&#x2014;ye shall lie down in sorrow.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren, concerning this righteous branch of which I have spoken.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ&#x2014;for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name&#x2014;should come among the Jews, among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify him&#x2014;for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For should the mighty miracles be wrought among other nations they would repent, and know that he be their God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But because of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Wherefore, because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, pestilences, and bloodshed shall come upon them; and they who shall not be destroyed shall be scattered among all nations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with their fathers that they shall be restored in the flesh, upon the earth, unto the lands of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that they shall be gathered in from their long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the four parts of the earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto them, and their queens shall become nursing mothers; wherefore, the promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and who can dispute?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But behold, this land, said God, shall be a land of thine inheritance, and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles, and there shall be no kings upon the land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I will fortify this land against all other nations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And he that fighteth against Zion shall perish, saith God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For he that raiseth up a king against me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a light unto them forever, that hear my words.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret works of darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Wherefore, he that fighteth against Zion, both Jew and Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female, shall perish; for they are they who are the whore of all the earth; for they who are not for me are against me, saith our God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For I will fulfil my promises which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our God: I will afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I will soften the hearts of the Gentiles, that they shall be like unto a father to them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall be blessed and numbered among the house of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Wherefore, I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and them who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever, for the land of their inheritance; for it is a choice land, saith God unto me, above all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they shall worship me, saith God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been driven out of the land of our inheritance; but we have been led to a better land, for the Lord has made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon the isles of the sea; wherefore as it says isles, there must needs be more than this, and they are inhabited also by our brethren.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from the house of Israel, according to his will and pleasure.  And now behold, the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off, wherefore he remembereth us also.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves&#x2014;to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, reconcile yourselves to the will of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; and remember, after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the grace of God that ye are saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_10.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Wherefore, may God raise you from death by the power of the resurrection, and also from everlasting death by the power of the atonement, that ye may be received into the eternal kingdom of God, that ye may praise him through grace divine.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted with all the house of Israel&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement&#x2014;save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption.  Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration.  And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace!  For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O how great the plan of our God!  For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it shall come to pass that when all men shall have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the holy judgment of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken it, and it is his eternal word, which cannot pass away, that they who are righteous shall be righteous still, and they who are filthy shall be filthy still; wherefore, they who are filthy are the devil and his angels; and they shall go away into everlasting fire, prepared for them; and their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever and has no end.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> O the greatness and the justice of our God!  For he executeth all his words, and they have gone forth out of his mouth, and his law must be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, they who have believed in the Holy One of Israel, they who have endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it, they shall inherit the kingdom of God, which was prepared for them from the foundation of the world, and their joy shall be full forever.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel!  For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster the devil, and death, and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> O how great the holiness of our God!  For he knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be baptized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned; for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Wherefore, he has given a law; and where there is no law given there is no punishment; and where there is no punishment there is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation the mercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement; for they are delivered by the power of him.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all those who have not the law given to them, that they are delivered from that awful monster, death and hell, and the devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them breath, which is the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But wo unto him that has the law given, yea, that has all the commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of his probation, for awful is his state!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> O that cunning plan of the evil one!  O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men!  When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not.  And they shall perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the world.  For because they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore, their treasure is their god.  And behold, their treasure shall perish with them also.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And wo unto the deaf that will not hear; for they shall perish.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_9.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart, for a knowledge of their iniquities shall smite them at the last day.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_9.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in transgressing against that Holy God, and also the awfulness of yielding to the enticings of that cunning one.  Remember, to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words.  Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel.  Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will revile against the truth; for I have spoken the words of your Maker.  I know that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for they love the truth and are not shaken.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy One.  Remember that his paths are righteous.  Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and the learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches&#x2014;yea, they are they whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things away, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> But the things of the wise and the prudent shall be hid from them forever&#x2014;yea, that happiness which is prepared for the saints.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> O, my beloved brethren, remember my words.  Behold, I take off my garments, and I shake them before you; I pray the God of my salvation that he view me with his all-searching eye; wherefore, ye shall know at the last day, when all men shall be judged of their works, that the God of Israel did witness that I shook your iniquities from my soul, and that I stand with brightness before him, and am rid of your blood.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> O, my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off the chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God who is the rock of your salvation.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> Prepare your souls for that glorious day when justice shall be administered unto the righteous, even the day of judgment, that ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not remember your awful guilt in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God Almighty&#x2014;but I know my guilt; I transgressed thy law, and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful misery.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> But behold, my brethren, is it expedient that I should awake you to an awful reality of these things?  Would I harrow up your souls if your minds were pure?  Would I be plain unto you according to the plainness of the truth if ye were freed from sin?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> Behold, if ye were holy I would speak unto you of holiness; but as ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher, it must needs be expedient that I teach you the consequences of sin.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, and my heart delighteth in righteousness; and I will praise the holy name of my God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> Come, my brethren, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy.  Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God; pray unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name by night.  Let your hearts rejoice.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> And behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how great his condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his greatness, and his grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh, but that he would preserve them; and in future generations they shall become a righteous branch unto the house of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_9.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> And now, my brethren, I would speak unto you more; but on the morrow I will declare unto you the remainder of my words.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_15.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets.  For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_15.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly; none shall be weary nor stumble among them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_15.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> None shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken;</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_25.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah.  For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the word which he hath spoken.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy.  But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the words unto mine own people; for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last days; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them, immediately after my father left Jerusalem; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those which are carried away captive into Babylon.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now this I speak because of the spirit which is in me. And notwithstanding they have been carried away they shall return again, and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall be restored again to the land of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is laid in a sepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God.  Wherefore, my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the people of his church.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered by other nations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations, yea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which is infinite for all mankind&#x2014;and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with pure hearts and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the day will come that it must needs be expedient that they should believe these things.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state.  Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given them for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which should deceive the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err.  And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be judged of them according to the words which are written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may know the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness of the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ, and know for what end the law was given.  And after the law is fulfilled in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts against him when the law ought to be done away.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people; wherefore, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand.  And the words which I have spoken shall stand as a testimony against you; for they are sufficient to teach any man the right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And, inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the performances and ordinances of God until the law shall be fulfilled which was given unto Moses.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_26.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And after Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show himself unto you, my children, and my beloved brethren; and the words which he shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye shall do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many generations shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and contentions among my people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them; wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as stubble.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_26.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people!  For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways are just.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution&#x2014;behold, they are they which shall not perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But the Son of Righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light, therefore they must go down to hell.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction, and this grieveth my soul.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days; concerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things forth unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them; and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the prayers of the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which shall be done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away&#x2014;yea, thus saith the Lord God: It shall be at an instant, suddenly&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it shall come to pass, that those who have dwindled in unbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there are many churches built up which cause envyings, and strifes, and malice.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God worketh not in darkness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.  Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without price.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the synagogues, or out of the houses of worship?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love.  And except they should have charity they were nothing.  Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men should not murder; that they should not lie; that they should not steal; that they should not take the name of the Lord their God in vain; that they should not envy; that they should not have malice; that they should not contend one with another; that they should not commit whoredoms; and that they should do none of these things; for whoso doeth them shall perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the things which shall be written out of the book shall be of great worth unto the children of men, and especially unto our seed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am the Lord&#x2019;s; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lord&#x2019;s; and thus shall every one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they shall contend one with another; and their priests shall contend one with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they deny the power of God, the Holy One of Israel; and they say unto the people: Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept; for behold there is no God today, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done his work, and he hath given his power unto men;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they shall say there is a miracle wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for this day he is not a God of miracles; he hath done his work.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God&#x2014;he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, they have all gone out of the way; they have become corrupted.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Because of pride, and because of false teachers, and false doctrine, their churches have become corrupted, and their churches are lifted up; because of pride they are puffed up.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> They rob the poor because of their fine sanctuaries; they rob the poor because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the meek and the poor in heart, because in their pride they are puffed up.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and because of pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have all gone astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are led, that in many instances they do err because they are taught by the precepts of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false doctrines, and all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord, wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord God Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught and revile against that which is good, and say that it is of no worth!  For the day shall come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are fully ripe in iniquity they shall perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of their wickedness and abominations they shall not be destroyed, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, that great and abominable church, the whore of all the earth, must tumble to the earth, and great must be the fall thereof.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well&#x2014;and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none&#x2014;and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need no more!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and are angry because of the truth of God!  For behold, he that is built upon the rock receiveth it with gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith the Lord God of Hosts!  For notwithstanding I shall lengthen out mine arm unto them from day to day, they will deny me; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto them, saith the Lord God, if they will repent and come unto me; for mine arm is lengthened out all the day long, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_27.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise, and with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye shall be drunken but not with wine, ye shall stagger but not with strong drink.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep.  For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have rejected the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of your iniquity.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the words of a book, and they shall be the words of them which have slumbered.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations of the people.  Wherefore the book shall be kept from them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words of the book, which are the words of those who have slumbered in the dust, and he shall deliver these words unto another;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But the words which are sealed he shall not deliver, neither shall he deliver the book.  For the book shall be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for behold, they reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may show them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee.  And the learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, because of the glory of the world and to get gain will they say this, and not for the glory of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is sealed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that is not learned shall say: I am not learned.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Touch not the things which are sealed, for I will bring them forth in mine own due time; for I will show unto the children of men that I am able to do mine own work.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read, until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And again it shall come to pass that the Lord shall say unto him that shall read the words that shall be delivered him:</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord!  And their works are in the dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and who knoweth us?  And they also say: Surely, your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter&#x2019;s clay.  But behold, I will show unto them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that I know all their works.  For shall the work say of him that made it, he made me not?  Or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, he had no understanding?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> But behold, saith the Lord of Hosts: I will show unto the children of men that it is yet a very little while and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field; and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And the meek also shall increase, and their joy shall be in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For assuredly as the Lord liveth they shall see that the terrible one is brought to naught, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And they that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Therefore, thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_29.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember your seed; and that the words of your seed should proceed forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And because my words shall hiss forth&#x2014;many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible!  A Bible!  We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people.  And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them?  Yea, what do the Gentiles mean?  Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people?  Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them.  But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible.  Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Know ye not that there are more nations than one?  Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word?  Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another?  Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another.  And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words according to mine own pleasure.

            <li id="2 ne_29.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one.  And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_30.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you; for I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye should suppose that ye are more righteous than the Gentiles shall be.  For behold, except ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall all likewise perish; and because of the words which have been spoken ye need not suppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles.  For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And then shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them; wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a pure and a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to gather in upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe in Christ shall also become a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his work among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration of his people upon the earth.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth.  And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a great division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy; and he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the wicked by fire.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice&#x2019;s den.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time.  And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_31.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren.  And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men.  For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Know ye not that he was holy?  But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me.  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism&#x2014;yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful.  He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter.  For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.  Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.  And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_32.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way.  But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ.  Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh.  And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing.  For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_33.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people.

            <li id="2 ne_33.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people.  And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the words which I have written save he shall be of the spirit of the devil.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_17.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it was told the house of David, saying: Syria is confederate with Ephraim.  And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_17.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Then said the Lord unto Isaiah: Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller&#x2019;s field;</li>

In other words, he was writing about our day. And there&#x2019;s reason to be concerned about what he saw: people denying the power and miracles of God; widespread jealousy and conflict. But in addition to these latter-day &#x201C;works of darkness&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.10,22?lang=eng#p10">2&#xA0;Nephi 26:10,&#xA0;22</a>) led by the adversary, Nephi also spoke of &#x201C;a marvelous work and a wonder&#x201D; led by God Himself (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.26?lang=eng#p26">2&#xA0;Nephi 27:26</a>). Central to that work would be a book&#x2014;a book that exposes Satan&#x2019;s lies and gathers the righteous. That book is the Book of Mormon, the marvelous work is the work of the Lord&#x2019;s Church in the latter days, and the wonder is&#x2014;at least in part&#x2014;that God invites all of us, despite our weaknesses, to participate in the gathering.</p>

How does He &#x201C;draw all men&#x201D;&#x2014;and you&#x2014;&#x201C;unto him&#x201D;? What do you feel inspired to do in response to His expressions of love?</p>

<p data-aid="154070832" id="p26">Perhaps you can think of an object lesson that will help your children understand what it means to learn &#x201C;line upon line.&#x201D; For example, they could put together a puzzle or build something with blocks, one piece at a time. Or you could teach them a skill step by step, such as tying a bow or drawing a picture. You could then read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p30">2&#xA0;Nephi 28:30</a> and discuss how Heavenly Father teaches us one truth at a time.</p>

<p data-aid="154070841" id="p27">Another idea could be to choose a phrase from <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p30">2&#xA0;Nephi 28:30</a> and take turns writing it, one word at a time. How is this like the way God gives us truth? Why does God reveal truth to us &#x201C;line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little&#x201D; instead of all at once?

<p data-aid="154070292" id="p1">The writings of Isaiah include strong warnings, but they also offer hope and joy. This is one reason Nephi included them in his record: &#x201C;I write some of the words of Isaiah,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;that whoso &#x2026; shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.8?lang=eng#p8">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:8</a>). In a sense, the invitation to read Isaiah&#x2019;s writings is an invitation to rejoice. You can take delight, as Nephi did, in Isaiah&#x2019;s prophecies about the gathering of Israel, the coming of the Messiah, and the peace promised to the righteous. You can rejoice to live in the prophesied day when the Lord has &#x201C;set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/21.12?lang=eng#p12">2&#xA0;Nephi 21:12</a>). When you thirst after righteousness, you can &#x201C;with joy &#x2026; draw water out of the wells of salvation&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/22.3?lang=eng#p3">2&#xA0;Nephi 22:3</a>). In other words, you can &#x201C;rejoice in Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#p26">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:26</a>).</p>

But to Nephi&#x2019;s people&#x2014;and to us today&#x2014;the bigger threat is what Babylon represents: worldliness and sin. Consider how the warnings in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/23?lang=eng">2&#xA0;Nephi 23&#x2013;24</a> might have affected people who feared or admired or trusted Babylon&#x2019;s wealth and power (see, for example <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/23.6-9,11,19-22?lang=eng#p6">23:6&#x2013;9, 11, 19&#x2013;22</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/24.10-19?lang=eng#p10">24:10&#x2013;19</a>).

<p data-aid="154070478" id="p9">Nephi was open about sharing his beliefs&#x2014;especially his testimony of Jesus Christ. Throughout your study of <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng">2&#xA0;Nephi&#xA0;25</a>, think about Nephi&#x2019;s desire to &#x201C;persuade [his] children &#x2026; to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng#p23">verse&#xA0;23</a>). What did Nephi want people to know about the Savior? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.12-13,16?lang=eng#p12">verses 12&#x2013;13,&#xA0;16</a>). How did Nephi try to persuade people to believe in Him? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.19-29?lang=eng#p19">verses 19&#x2013;29</a>). Note passages in this chapter that persuade you to believe in and follow Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="154070499" id="p10">Some of us may not feel as bold as Nephi was about talking of Christ. But maybe you can find something in Nephi&#x2019;s teachings in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23-26?lang=eng#p23">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:23&#x2013;26</a> that inspires you to talk about Him with others more openly. For example, Nephi&#x2019;s declaration &#x201C;We rejoice in Christ&#x201D; might prompt you to think about how the Savior brings you joy&#x2014;and how you can share that joy with others.</p>
<p data-aid="154070514" id="p11">In his message &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2020/10/45andersen?lang=eng">We Talk of Christ</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2020, 88&#x2013;91), Elder Neil&#xA0;L.

<p data-aid="154070326" id="p6">One way to deepen your appreciation for Jesus Christ is to think about what would have happened to us without Him. As you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.1-26?lang=eng#p1">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:1&#x2013;26</a>, consider listing or marking in one color what would happen to us without the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Then, in another list or color, you could identify what we can receive through the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement. Based on what you read, how would you explain why we need the Atonement of Jesus Christ? What did you find that inspires you to praise the &#x201C;wisdom of God, his mercy and grace&#x201D;? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.8?lang=eng#p8">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:8</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154070336" id="p7">In addition to teaching what Jesus Christ saved us from, Jacob also gave insights about how He did it. Consider recording what you find in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.11-15,20-24?lang=eng#p11">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:11&#x2013;15, 20&#x2013;24</a>.</p>
<p data-aid="154070344" id="p8">Jacob was so awed by God&#x2019;s plan of redemption that he exclaimed, &#x201C;O how great the plan of our God.&#x201D; Look for his exclamations in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng">2&#xA0;Nephi&#xA0;9</a> (most of them are found in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.8-20?lang=eng#p8">verses 8&#x2013;20</a>). What do you learn from these verses about God&#x2019;s plan? What experiences have helped you feel some of what Jacob felt? As part of your worship and study, consider looking for a hymn that might express how you feel about Him, such as &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/how-great-thou-art?lang=eng">How Great Thou Art</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;86).</p>

<p data-aid="154070560" id="p16">One way to help your children understand why we need the Savior is to teach them about the Fall.

Perhaps <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.6-10?lang=eng#p6">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:6&#x2013;10</a> can help them see what Jesus Christ does for us.

<p data-aid="154070262" id="p1">Engraving on metal plates is not easy, and space on Nephi&#x2019;s small plates was limited. So why would Nephi make the effort of copying so many of the writings of the prophet Isaiah into his record? He did it because he wanted us to believe in Jesus Christ. &#x201C;My soul delighteth,&#x201D; he wrote, &#x201C;in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.4?lang=eng#p4">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:4</a>). Nephi had seen what would happen to his people in future generations. He saw that, despite their great blessings, they would become prideful, contentious, and worldly (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12?lang=eng">1&#xA0;Nephi&#xA0;12</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.4-6?lang=eng#p4">15:4&#x2013;6</a>). He also saw similar problems in our day (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng">1&#xA0;Nephi&#xA0;14</a>). Isaiah&#x2019;s writings warned against such wickedness. But they also gave Nephi hope for a glorious future&#x2014;an end to wickedness, a gathering of the faithful, and &#x201C;great light&#x201D; for people who had &#x201C;walked in darkness&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19.2?lang=eng#p2">2&#xA0;Nephi 19:2</a>). All this would happen because &#x201C;a child [was] born&#x201D; who could end all strife&#x2014;&#x201C;The Prince of Peace&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19.6?lang=eng#p6">2&#xA0;Nephi 19:6</a>).</p>

<h3 data-aid="154070278" id="title3">How can I better understand the teachings of Isaiah?</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154070287" id="p2">Nephi acknowledged that &#x201C;the words of Isaiah are not plain&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.4?lang=eng#p4">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:4</a>). But he also shared ideas to help us find meaning in Isaiah&#x2019;s writings:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154070296" id="p3">&#x201C;<strong>Liken his words unto&#x201D; yourself</strong> (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.2?lang=eng#p2">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:2</a>). Many of Isaiah&#x2019;s teachings have multiple possible meanings and applications. For example, when you read about dwelling places in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/14.5-6?lang=eng#p5">2&#xA0;Nephi 14:5&#x2013;6</a>, consider how these verses apply to your home. Ask yourself, &#x201C;What does Heavenly Father want me to learn?&#x201D;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070305" id="p4"><strong>Look for symbols of Jesus Christ</strong> (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.4?lang=eng#p4">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:4</a>). Many of Isaiah&#x2019;s teachings about the Savior are conveyed through symbols. For example, how is the Savior represented in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19.2?lang=eng#p2">2&#xA0;Nephi 19:2</a>? What does this symbol teach you about Him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070314" id="p5"><strong>Seek to be &#x201C;filled with the spirit of prophecy</strong>&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.4?lang=eng#p4">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:4</a>). As you study, pray for spiritual guidance. You may not understand everything at first, but the Spirit can help you learn what you need to know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154070325" id="p6">You might also find it helpful to refer to the <a href="/study/scriptures/study-helps?lang=eng">study helps</a> in the scriptures, including the footnotes, chapter headings, and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/gs?lang=eng">Guide to the Scriptures</a>. The Book of Mormon and Old Testament institute manuals have additional information that can help you learn about the historical context of Isaiah&#x2019;s teachings.</p>

So it&#x2019;s not surprising that Nephi would share with his people Isaiah&#x2019;s repeated warnings against pride.

Write one or more truths each passage teaches about our day: <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/12.1-5?lang=eng#p1">2&#xA0;Nephi 12:1&#x2013;5</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/14.2-6?lang=eng#p2">14:2&#x2013;6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/15.20-26?lang=eng#p20">15:20&#x2013;26</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19.2-8?lang=eng#p2">19:2&#x2013;8</a>.

<p data-aid="154070567" id="figure1_p1"><strong>Look for patterns.</strong> In the scriptures we can find patterns that show us how the Lord works. In <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11?lang=eng">2&#xA0;Nephi 11&#x2013;19</a>, you might look for patterns that show how the Lord warns of sin and forgives people who repent.</p>
