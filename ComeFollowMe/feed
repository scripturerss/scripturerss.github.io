            <li id="alma_50.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making preparations for war, or to defend his people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges, that they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round about all the cities, throughout all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there should be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about the cities.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a frame of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they were strong and high.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and slay him who should attempt to approach near the walls of the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their enemies, round about every city in all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites who were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea to the west.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants who were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders by the seashore, and possess the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their possessions, and caused them to erect fortifications that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the river Sidon&#x2014;the Nephites possessing all the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possession.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one in a particular manner which they called Lehi, which was in the north by the borders of the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus ended the twentieth year.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi in the commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_50.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land.  But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their destructions.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign of the judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a contention which took place among them concerning the land of Lehi, and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the borders of Lehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did claim a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began to be a warm contention between them, insomuch that the people of Morianton took up arms against their brethren, and they were determined by the sword to slay them.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to the camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for assistance; for behold they were not in the wrong.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who were led by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceedingly fearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which was northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which would have been a cause to have been lamented) but behold, Morianton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her much.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of Moroni, and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and also concerning their intentions to flee into the land northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of Morianton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi, yea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people of Morianton, to stop their flight into the land northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that they did not head them until they had come to the borders of the land Desolation; and there they did head them, by the narrow pass which led by the sea into the land northward, yea, by the sea, on the west and on the east.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so stubborn were the people of Morianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering words) that a battle commenced between them, in the which Teancum did slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of Moroni.  And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus were the people of Morianton brought back.  And upon their covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that in the same year that the people of Nephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second chief judge, died, having filled the judgment-seat with perfect uprightness before God.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those records and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son, Helaman.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed chief judge and governor over the people, with an oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime.</li>
            <li id="alma_50.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> Now behold, his name was Pahoran.  And Pahoran did fill the seat of his father, and did commence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year, over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_55.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he was more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of his fraud; yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it was not a just cause that had caused him to wage a war against the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron save he will withdraw his purpose, as I have stated in my epistle; for I will not grant unto him that he shall have any more power than what he hath got.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my people whom they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not grant unto me mine epistle, behold, I will give unto him according to my words; yea, I will seek death among them until they shall sue for peace.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he caused that a search should be made among his men, that perhaps he might find a man who was a descendant of Laman among them.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman; and he was one of the servants of the king who was murdered by Amalickiah.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men should go forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore Moroni appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men should go with him.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over the Nephites, and behold, they saw him coming and they hailed him; but he saith unto them: Fear not; behold, I am a Lamanite.  Behold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleep; and behold we have taken of their wine and brought with us.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad that ye have thus taken wine with you for we are weary.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go against the Nephites to battle.  But this saying only made them more desirous to drink of the wine;</li>
            <li id="alma_55.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strengthen us to go against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it was pleasant to their taste, therefore they took of it more freely; and it was strong, having been prepared in its strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they were all drunken.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and were in a deep sleep, they returned to Moroni and told him all the things that had happened.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now this was according to the design of Moroni.  And Moroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep and drunken, and cast in weapons of war unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;</li>
            <li id="alma_55.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as many as were able to use a weapon of war, when Moroni had armed all those prisoners; and all those things were done in a profound silence.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken and the Nephites could have slain them.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners of the Nephites who were within the wall of the city, and had given them power to gain possession of those parts which were within the walls.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the Lamanites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief captains demanded their weapons of war, and they brought them forth and cast them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni.  He took them prisoners of war, and took possession of the city, and caused that all the prisoners should be liberated, who were Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had taken prisoners, that they should commence a labor in strengthening the fortifications round about the city Gid.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid, according to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be taken to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an exceedingly strong force.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the intrigues of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners whom they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the advantage which they had retaken.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites began again to be victorious, and to reclaim their rights and their privileges.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Many times did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night, but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine to the Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord their God in this their time of affliction.  They could not be taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And they were thus cautious that no poison should be administered among them; for if their wine would poison a Lamanite it would also poison a Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make preparations to attack the city Morianton; for behold, the Lamanites had, by their labors, fortified the city Morianton until it had become an exceeding stronghold.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and also new supplies of provisions.</li>
            <li id="alma_55.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_49.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the nineteenth year, on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the Lamanites were seen approaching towards the land of Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an army by the borders of the city, and they had cast up dirt round about to shield them from the arrows and the stones of the Lamanites; for behold, they fought with stones and with arrows.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the Nephites had dug up a ridge of earth round about them, which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them that they might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of entrance.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were astonished exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their places of security.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the greatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also prepared themselves with shields, and with breastplates; and they had also prepared themselves with garments of skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily overpower and subject their brethren to the yoke of bondage, or slay and massacre them according to their pleasure.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared for them, in a manner which never had been known among the children of Lehi.  Now they were prepared for the Lamanites, to battle after the manner of the instructions of Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, were exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for war.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi, at the head of his army, perhaps he would have caused the Lamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah; for behold, he did care not for the blood of his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle.  And behold, his chief captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs among the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were disappointed in their places of retreat and they could not come upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp and marched towards the land of Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for them to come against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built forts of security, for every city in all the land round about; therefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, their chief captains came forward and took an oath that they would destroy the people of that city.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which had hitherto been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, become strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed that they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they would march thither to battle; and thus it was according to his desires.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the Lamanites in the valley on the east of the river Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless their chief captains had sworn with an oath to attack the city; therefore, they brought up their armies.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of security by any other way save by the entrance, because of the highness of the bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch which had been dug round about, save it were by the entrance.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any other way, by casting over stones and arrows at them.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with their swords and their slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come into their place of security by the place of entrance; and thus were they prepared to defend themselves against the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with an immense slaughter.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth that they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown at them; and instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in a measure with their dead and wounded bodies.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness.  And it came to pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth, concerning their great loss.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his people, because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did curse God, and also Moroni, swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood; and this because Moroni had kept the commandments of God in preparing for the safety of his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did thank the Lord their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_49.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly great prosperity in the church because of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach among the people.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_54.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and ninth year of the judges, that Ammoron sent unto Moroni desiring that he would exchange prisoners.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that Moroni felt to rejoice exceedingly at this request, for he desired the provisions which were imparted for the support of the Lamanite prisoners for the support of his own people; and he also desired his own people for the strengthening of his army.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now the Lamanites had taken many women and children, and there was not a woman nor a child among all the prisoners of Moroni, or the prisoners whom Moroni had taken; therefore Moroni resolved upon a stratagem to obtain as many prisoners of the Nephites from the Lamanites as it were possible.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore he wrote an epistle, and sent it by the servant of Ammoron, the same who had brought an epistle to Moroni.  Now these are the words which he wrote unto Ammoron, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_54.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, Ammoron, I have written unto you somewhat concerning this war which ye have waged against my people, or rather which thy brother hath waged against them, and which ye are still determined to carry on after his death.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, I would tell you somewhat concerning the justice of God, and the sword of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you except ye repent and withdraw your armies into your own lands, or the land of your possessions, which is the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Yea, I would tell you these things if ye were capable of hearkening unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful hell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy brother have been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your armies to your own lands.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But as ye have once rejected these things, and have fought against the people of the Lord, even so I may expect you will do it again.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now behold, we are prepared to receive you; yea, and except you withdraw your purposes, behold, ye will pull down the wrath of that God whom you have rejected upon you, even to your utter destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But, as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you except ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited with death, for we will retain our cities and our lands; yea, and we will maintain our religion and the cause of our God.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning these things in vain; or it supposeth me that thou art a child of hell; therefore I will close my epistle by telling you that I will not exchange prisoners, save it be on conditions that ye will deliver up a man and his wife and his children, for one prisoner; if this be the case that ye will do it, I will exchange.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And behold, if ye do not this, I will come against you with my armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I will come against you, and I will follow you even into your own land, which is the land of our first inheritance; yea, and it shall be blood for blood, yea, life for life; and I will give you battle even until you are destroyed from off the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves.  But behold, if ye seek to destroy us more we will seek to destroy you; yea, and we will seek our land, the land of our first inheritance.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now I close my epistle.  I am Moroni; I am a leader of the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this epistle, was angry; and he wrote another epistle unto Moroni, and these are the words which he wrote, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_54.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of Amalickiah whom ye have murdered.  Behold, I will avenge his blood upon you, yea, and I will come upon you with my armies for I fear not your threatenings.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch that they did rob them of their right to the government when it rightly belonged unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject yourselves to be governed by those to whom the government doth rightly belong, then will I cause that my people shall lay down their weapons and shall be at war no more.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Behold, ye have breathed out many threatenings against me and my people; but behold, we fear not your threatenings.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to your request, gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of war; and we will wage a war which shall be eternal, either to the subjecting the Nephites to our authority or to their eternal extinction.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye; but if it so be that there is such a being, we know not but that he hath made us as well as you.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will he not send you there to dwell with my brother whom ye have murdered, whom ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place?  But behold these things matter not.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> I am Ammoron, and a descendant of Zoram, whom your fathers pressed and brought out of Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="alma_54.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And behold now, I am a bold Lamanite; behold, this war hath been waged to avenge their wrongs, and to maintain and to obtain their rights to the government; and I close my epistle to Moroni.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_53.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that they did set guards over the prisoners of the Lamanites, and did compel them to go forth and bury their dead, yea, and also the dead of the Nephites who were slain; and Moroni placed men over them to guard them while they should perform their labors.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command of the city and gave it unto Lehi.  Now behold, this Lehi was a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his battles; and he was a man like unto Moroni, and they rejoiced in each other&#x2019;s safety; yea, they were beloved by each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had finished burying their dead and also the dead of the Nephites, they were marched back into the land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders of Moroni, caused that they should commence laboring in digging a ditch round about the land, or the city, Bountiful.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers upon the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against the breastwork of timbers; and thus they did cause the Lamanites to labor until they had encircled the city of Bountiful round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And this city became an exceeding stronghold ever after; and in this city they did guard the prisoners of the Lamanites; yea, even within a wall which they had caused them to build with their own hands.  Now Moroni was compelled to cause the Lamanites to labor, because it was easy to guard them while at their labor; and he desired all his forces when he should make an attack upon the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over one of the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had obtained possession of the city of Mulek, which was one of the strongest holds of the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; and thus he had also built a stronghold to retain his prisoners.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with the Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for war, yea, and in making fortifications to guard against the Lamanites, yea, and also delivering their women and their children from famine and affliction, and providing food for their armies.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on the west sea, south, while in the absence of Moroni on account of some intrigue amongst the Nephites, which caused dissensions amongst them, had gained some ground over the Nephites, yea, insomuch that they had obtained possession of a number of their cities in that part of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus because of iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because of dissensions and intrigue among themselves they were placed in the most dangerous circumstances.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people of Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had been converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they never would shed blood more; and according to their oath they would have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to have fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for the pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his brethren had had for them.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And for this cause they were brought down into the land of Zarahemla; and they ever had been protected by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many afflictions and tribulations which the Nephites bore for them, they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the defence of their country.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war, they were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his brethren, for they were about to break the oath which they had made.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls; therefore all those who had entered into this covenant were compelled to behold their brethren wade through their afflictions, in their dangerous circumstances at this time.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty, but they would fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now behold, there were two thousand of those young men, who entered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great support; for they took their weapons of war, and they would that Helaman should be their leader.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all&#x2014;they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now it came to pass that Helaman did march at the head of his two thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people in the borders of the land on the south by the west sea.</li>
            <li id="alma_53.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

            <li id="alma_51.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the people of Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth year in peace;</li>
            <li id="alma_51.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a contention among the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who desired that a few particular points of the law should be altered.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered; therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the law.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them, for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled by the voice of the people.  And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those who sought power and authority over the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again stirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the people of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for war with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come to battle against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been, because of the many thousands who had been slain by the hand of the Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered together a wonderfully great army, insomuch that he feared not to come down to the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, even Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of the Lamanites.  And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges; and it was at the same time that they had begun to settle the affairs of their contentions concerning the chief judge, Pahoran.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not take up arms to defend their country.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceedingly wroth because of the stubbornness of those people whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of the people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and give him (Moroni) power to compel those dissenters to defend their country or to put them to death.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and dissensions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction.  And it came to pass that it was granted according to the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level them with the earth, or they should take up arms and support the cause of liberty.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them; and they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn down and leveled to the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders who were not slain in battle were taken and cast into prison, for there was no time for their trials at this period.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty upon their towers, and in their cities, and to take up arms in defence of their country.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not any known by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the stubbornness and the pride of those people who professed the blood of nobility; but they were brought down to humble themselves like unto their brethren, and to fight valiantly for their freedom from bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Behold, it came to pass that while Moroni was thus breaking down the wars and contentions among his own people, and subjecting them to peace and civilization, and making regulations to prepare for war against the Lamanites, behold, the Lamanites had come into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently strong in the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive them, slaying many.  And it came to pass that Amalickiah took possession of the city, yea, possession of all their fortifications.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And those who fled out of the city of Moroni came to the city of Nephihah; and also the people of the city of Lehi gathered themselves together, and made preparations and were ready to receive the Lamanites to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the Lamanites to go against the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept them down by the seashore, leaving men in every city to maintain and defend it.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus he went on, taking possession of many cities, the city of Nephihah, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Morianton, and the city of Omner, and the city of Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of which were on the east borders by the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of Amalickiah, so many cities, by their numberless hosts, all of which were strongly fortified after the manner of the fortifications of Moroni; all of which afforded strongholds for the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that they marched to the borders of the land Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them and slaying many.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had slain Morianton and had headed his people in his flight.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was marching forth with his numerous army that he might take possession of the land Bountiful, and also the land northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by Teancum and his men, for they were great warriors; for every man of Teancum did exceed the Lamanites in their strength and in their skill of war, insomuch that they did gain advantage over the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that they did slay them even until it was dark.  And it came to pass that Teancum and his men did pitch their tents in the borders of the land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the borders on the beach by the seashore, and after this manner were they driven.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and his servant stole forth and went out by night, and went into the camp of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had overpowered them because of their much fatigue, which was caused by the labors and heat of the day.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Teancum stole privily into the tent of the king, and put a javelin to his heart; and he did cause the death of the king immediately that he did not awake his servants.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his men were asleep, and he awoke them and told them all the things that he had done.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And he caused that his armies should stand in readiness, lest the Lamanites had awakened and should come upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_51.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and thus endeth the days of Amalickiah.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_58.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain the city of Manti; but behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the city by our small bands.  For behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto done; therefore we could not decoy them away from their strongholds.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we durst not go forth and attack them in their strongholds.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to the maintaining those parts of the land which we had regained of our possessions; therefore it became expedient that we should wait, that we might receive more strength from the land of Zarahemla and also a new supply of provisions.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the governor of our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of our people.  And it came to pass that we did wait to receive provisions and strength from the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites were also receiving great strength from day to day, and also many provisions; and thus were our circumstances at this period of time.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to time, resolving by stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we could not come to battle with them, because of their retreats and their strongholds.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that we did wait in these difficult circumstances for the space of many months, even until we were about to perish for the want of food.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was guarded to us by an army of two thousand men to our assistance; and this is all the assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves and our country from falling into the hands of our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they did not send more strength unto us, we knew not; therefore we were grieved and also filled with fear, lest by any means the judgments of God should come upon our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And we did take courage with our small force which we had received, and were fixed with a determination to conquer our enemies, and to maintain our lands, and our possessions, and our wives, and our children, and the cause of our liberty.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And thus we did go forth with all our might against the Lamanites, who were in the city of Manti; and we did pitch our tents by the wilderness side, which was near to the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow, that when the Lamanites saw that we were in the borders by the wilderness which was near the city, that they sent out their spies round about us that they might discover the number and the strength of our army.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that when they saw that we were not strong, according to our numbers, and fearing that we should cut them off from their support except they should come out to battle against us and kill us, and also supposing that they could easily destroy us with their numerous hosts, therefore they began to make preparations to come out against us to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And when we saw that they were making preparations to come out against us, behold, I caused that Gid, with a small number of men, should secrete himself in the wilderness, and also that Teomner and a small number of men should secrete themselves also in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the left; and when they had thus secreted themselves, behold, I remained, with the remainder of my army, in that same place where we had first pitched our tents against the time that the Lamanites should come out to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come out with their numerous army against us.  And when they had come and were about to fall upon us with the sword, I caused that my men, those who were with me, should retreat into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did follow after us with great speed, for they were exceedingly desirous to overtake us that they might slay us; therefore they did follow us into the wilderness; and we did pass by in the midst of Gid and Teomner, insomuch that they were not discovered by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had passed by, or when the army had passed by, Gid and Teomner did rise up from their secret places, and did cut off the spies of the Lamanites that they should not return to the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to the city and fell upon the guards who were left to guard the city, insomuch that they did destroy them and did take possession of the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now this was done because the Lamanites did suffer their whole army, save a few guards only, to be led away into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Gid and Teomner by this means had obtained possession of their strongholds.  And it came to pass that we took our course, after having traveled much in the wilderness towards the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards the land of Zarahemla, they were exceedingly afraid, lest there was a plan laid to lead them on to destruction; therefore they began to retreat into the wilderness again, yea, even back by the same way which they had come.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for the chief captains of the Lamanites had supposed that the Nephites were weary because of their march; and supposing that they had driven their whole army therefore they took no thought concerning the city of Manti.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that when it was night, I caused that my men should not sleep, but that they should march forward by another way towards the land of Manti.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And because of this our march in the night-time, behold, on the morrow we were beyond the Lamanites, insomuch that we did arrive before them at the city of Manti.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And thus it came to pass, that by this stratagem we did take possession of the city of Manti without the shedding of blood.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that when the armies of the Lamanites did arrive near the city, and saw that we were prepared to meet them, they were astonished exceedingly and struck with great fear, insomuch that they did flee into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Yea, and it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did flee out of all this quarter of the land.  But behold, they have carried with them many women and children out of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all of them are at this period of time in our possession; and our fathers and our women and our children are returning to their homes, all save it be those who have been taken prisoners and carried off by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But behold, our armies are small to maintain so great a number of cities and so great possessions.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But behold, we trust in our God who has given us victory over those lands, insomuch that we have obtained those cities and those lands, which were our own.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Now we do not know the cause that the government does not grant us more strength; neither do those men who came up unto us know why we have not received greater strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Behold, we do not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye have drawn away the forces into that quarter of the land; if so, we do not desire to murmur.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And if it is not so, behold, we fear that there is some faction in the government, that they do not send more men to our assistance; for we know that they are more numerous than that which they have sent.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But, behold, it mattereth not&#x2014;we trust God will deliver us, notwithstanding the weakness of our armies, yea, and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end, and we are in the possession of our lands; and the Lamanites have fled to the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And those sons of the people of Ammon, of whom I have so highly spoken, are with me in the city of Manti; and the Lord has supported them, yea, and kept them from falling by the sword, insomuch that even one soul has not been slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_58.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God, who has redeemed us and made us free, keep you continually in his presence; yea, and may he favor this people, even that ye may have success in obtaining the possession of all that which the Lamanites have taken from us, which was for our support.  And now, behold, I close mine epistle.  I am Helaman, the son of Alma.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_61.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his epistle unto the chief governor, he received an epistle from Pahoran, the chief governor.  And these are the words which he received:</li>
            <li id="alma_61.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army.  Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea, insomuch that they have risen up in rebellion against me, and also those of my people who are freemen, yea, and those who have risen up are exceedingly numerous.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great flattery, and they have led away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our freemen that they have not come unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have fled to the land of Gideon, with as many men as it were possible that I could get.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold, I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of the land; and behold, they are flocking to us daily, to their arms, in the defence of their country and their freedom, and to avenge our wrongs.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they have come unto us, insomuch that those who have risen up in rebellion against us are set at defiance, yea, insomuch that they do fear us and durst not come out against us to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> They have got possession of the land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they have appointed a king over them, and he hath written unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an alliance with him; in the which alliance he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the land, and he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be conquered under the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart.  I, Pahoran, do not seek for power, save only to retain my judgment-seat that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people.  My soul standeth fast in that liberty in the which God hath made us free.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, behold, we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed.  We would not shed the blood of the Lamanites if they would stay in their own land.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> We would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not rise up in rebellion and take the sword against us.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> We would subject ourselves to the yoke of bondage if it were requisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so to do.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But behold he doth not command us that we shall subject ourselves to our enemies, but that we should put our trust in him, and he will deliver us.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words, yea, such as rebellions and dissensions, let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church, and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Therefore, come unto me speedily with a few of your men, and leave the remainder in the charge of Lehi and Teancum; give unto them power to conduct the war in that part of the land, according to the Spirit of God, which is also the spirit of freedom which is in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Behold I have sent a few provisions unto them, that they may not perish until ye can come unto me.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march hither, and we will go speedily against those dissenters, in the strength of our God according to the faith which is in us.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we may obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go forth against them in the strength of the Lord, and we will put an end to this great iniquity.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I was somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it should be just in us to go against our brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But ye have said, except they repent the Lord hath commanded you that ye should go against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_61.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell them to fear not, for God will deliver them, yea, and also all those who stand fast in that liberty wherewith God hath made them free.  And now I close mine epistle to my beloved brother, Moroni.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the forty and second year of the reign of the judges, after Moronihah had established again peace between the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the judgment-seat; therefore there began to be a contention again among the people concerning who should fill the judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, who had entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment-seat to destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto him a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of his desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the judgment-seat that he might murder Helaman.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their secret plan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan.  And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him.  And they took their flight out of the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be found.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter.  And thus ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean the end of the book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have written.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_57.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron, the king, stating that if I would deliver up those prisoners of war whom we had taken that he would deliver up the city of Antiparah unto us.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But I sent an epistle unto the king, that we were sure our forces were sufficient to take the city of Antiparah by our force; and by delivering up the prisoners for that city we should suppose ourselves unwise, and that we would only deliver up our prisoners on exchange.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange prisoners; therefore we began to make preparations to go against the city of Antiparah.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their other cities, which they had possession of, to fortify them; and thus the city of Antiparah fell into our hands.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and ninth year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an addition to our army, from the land of Zarahemla, and from the land round about, to the number of six thousand men, besides sixty of the sons of the Ammonites who had come to join their brethren, my little band of two thousand.  And now behold, we were strong, yea, and we had also plenty of provisions brought unto us.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with the army which was placed to protect the city Cumeni.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our strong force, we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a little before they were to receive a supply of provisions.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for many nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards, that the Lamanites could not come upon us by night and slay us, which they attempted many times; but as many times as they attempted this their blood was spilt.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to enter the city by night.  And we, instead of being Lamanites, were Nephites; therefore, we did take them and their provisions.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And notwithstanding the Lamanites being cut off from their support after this manner, they were still determined to maintain the city; therefore it became expedient that we should take those provisions and send them to Judea, and our prisoners to the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that not many days had passed away before the Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they yielded up the city unto our hands; and thus we had accomplished our designs in obtaining the city Cumeni.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous that, notwithstanding the enormity of our numbers, we were obliged to employ all our force to keep them, or to put them to death.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would fight with stones, and with clubs, or whatsoever thing they could get into their hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an end to their lives, or guard them, sword in hand, down to the land of Zarahemla; and also our provisions were not any more than sufficient for our own people, notwithstanding that which we had taken from the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very serious matter to determine concerning these prisoners of war; nevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of Zarahemla; therefore we selected a part of our men, and gave them charge over our prisoners to go down to the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return.  And now behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in season to save us from falling into their hands.  For behold, Ammoron had sent to their support a new supply of provisions and also a numerous army of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the prisoners did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to overpower us.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer death unto all those who opposed them.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great victory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore they were driven back to the city of Manti.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I immediately gave orders that my men who had been wounded should be taken from among the dead, and caused that their wounds should be dressed.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain.  And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe&#x2014;that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now it came to pass that after we had thus taken care of our wounded men, and had buried our dead and also the dead of the Lamanites, who were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid concerning the prisoners whom they had started to go down to the land of Zarahemla with.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to guard them down to the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold, we did start to go down to the land of Zarahemla with our prisoners.  And it came to pass that we did meet the spies of our armies, who had been sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they cried unto us, saying&#x2014;Behold, the armies of the Lamanites are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries, which caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass because of their rebellion we did cause that our swords should come upon them.  And it came to pass that they did in a body run upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke through and fled from us.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we took our march with speed towards the city Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren in preserving the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies.  And blessed is the name of our God; for behold, it is he that has delivered us; yea, that has done this great thing for us.</li>
            <li id="alma_57.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of Gid, I was filled with exceeding joy because of the goodness of God in preserving us, that we might not all perish; yea, and I trust that the souls of them who have been slain have entered into the rest of their God.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now these are their names who did contend for the judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for he had many), but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat; therefore, they did cause three divisions among the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be chief judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did unite with the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth; therefore, he was about to flatter away those people to rise up in rebellion against their brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the liberty of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now when those people who were desirous that he should be their governor saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry, and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake him.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran.  And Kishkumen and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found were condemned unto death.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the voice of the people, to be a chief judge and a governor over the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right.  And all this was done in the fortieth year of the reign of the judges; and it had an end.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass in the forty and first year of the reign of the judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an innumerable army of men, and armed them with swords, and with cimeters and with bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates, and with breastplates, and with all manner of shields of every kind.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And they came down again that they might pitch battle against the Nephites.  And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron, supposing that Coriantumr, being a mighty man, could stand against the Nephites, with his strength and also with his great wisdom, insomuch that by sending him forth he should gain power over the Nephites&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that they should march down to the land of Zarahemla to battle against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much difficulty in the government, that they had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their lands to attack that great city Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was with such exceedingly great speed that there was no time for the Nephites to gather together their armies.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch that they did take possession of the whole city.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that Pacumeni, who was the chief judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr did smite him against the wall, insomuch that he died.  And thus ended the days of Pacumeni.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart took courage insomuch that he was about to go forth against all the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And, supposing that their greatest strength was in the center of the land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves together save it were in small bodies; and in this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the center of the land gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the number of the Nephites who were slain.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the center of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and had taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strongholds.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent forth Lehi with an army round about to head them before they should come to the land Bountiful.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And thus he did; and he did head them before they came to the land Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that Moronihah did head them in their retreat, and did give unto them battle, insomuch that it became an exceedingly bloody battle; yea, many were slain, and among the number who were slain Coriantumr was also found.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now, behold, the Lamanites could not retreat either way, neither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on the west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into the midst of the Nephites, insomuch that they were in the power of the Nephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield themselves into the hands of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the city of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites who had been taken prisoners should depart out of the land in peace.</li>
            <li id="hel_1.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>

            <li id="alma_60.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that he wrote again to the governor of the land, who was Pahoran, and these are the words which he wrote, saying: Behold, I direct mine epistle to Pahoran, in the city of Zarahemla, who is the chief judge and the governor over the land, and also to all those who have been chosen by this people to govern and manage the affairs of this war.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of condemnation; for behold, ye yourselves know that ye have been appointed to gather together men, and arm them with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war of every kind, and send forth against the Lamanites, in whatsoever parts they should come into our land.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now behold, I say unto you that myself, and also my men, and also Helaman and his men, have suffered exceedingly great sufferings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and all manner of afflictions of every kind.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But behold, were this all we had suffered we would not murmur nor complain.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But behold, great has been the slaughter among our people; yea, thousands have fallen by the sword, while it might have otherwise been if ye had rendered unto our armies sufficient strength and succor for them.  Yea, great has been your neglect towards us.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now behold, we desire to know the cause of this exceedingly great neglect; yea, we desire to know the cause of your thoughtless state.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Can you think to sit upon your thrones in a state of thoughtless stupor, while your enemies are spreading the work of death around you?  Yea, while they are murdering thousands of your brethren&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_60.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have placed you in a situation that ye might have succored them, yea, ye might have sent armies unto them, to have strengthened them, and have saved thousands of them from falling by the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, this is not all&#x2014;ye have withheld your provisions from them, insomuch that many have fought and bled out their lives because of their great desires which they had for the welfare of this people; yea, and this they have done when they were about to perish with hunger, because of your exceedingly great neglect towards them.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, my beloved brethren&#x2014;for ye ought to be beloved; yea, and ye ought to have stirred yourselves more diligently for the welfare and the freedom of this people; but behold, ye have neglected them insomuch that the blood of thousands shall come upon your heads for vengeance; yea, for known unto God were all their cries, and all their sufferings&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_60.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and because of the exceeding goodness of God ye could do nothing and he would deliver you?  Behold, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Do ye suppose that, because so many of your brethren have been killed it is because of their wickedness?  I say unto you, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain; for I say unto you, there are many who have fallen by the sword; and behold it is to your condemnation;</li>
            <li id="alma_60.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need not suppose that the righteous are lost because they are slain; but behold, they do enter into the rest of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now behold, I say unto you, I fear exceedingly that the judgments of God will come upon this people, because of their exceeding slothfulness, yea, even the slothfulness of our government, and their exceedingly great neglect towards their brethren, yea, towards those who have been slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For were it not for the wickedness which first commenced at our head, we could have withstood our enemies that they could have gained no power over us.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out among ourselves; yea, were it not for these king-men, who caused so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, at the time we were contending among ourselves, if we had united our strength as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been for the desire of power and authority which those king-men had over us; had they been true to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against our enemies, instead of taking up their swords against us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth against them in the strength of the Lord, we should have dispersed our enemies, for it would have been done, according to the fulfilling of his word.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, taking possession of our lands, and they are murdering our people with the sword, yea, our women and our children, and also carrying them away captive, causing them that they should suffer all manner of afflictions, and this because of the great wickedness of those who are seeking for power and authority, yea, even those king-men.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But why should I say much concerning this matter?  For we know not but what ye yourselves are seeking for authority.  We know not but what ye are also traitors to your country.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Or is it that ye have neglected us because ye are in the heart of our country and ye are surrounded by security, that ye do not cause food to be sent unto us, and also men to strengthen our armies?</li>
            <li id="alma_60.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Have ye forgotten the commandments of the Lord your God? Yea, have ye forgotten the captivity of our fathers?  Have ye forgotten the many times we have been delivered out of the hands of our enemies?</li>
            <li id="alma_60.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while we sit upon our thrones and do not make use of the means which the Lord has provided for us?</li>
            <li id="alma_60.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, will ye sit in idleness while ye are surrounded with thousands of those, yea, and tens of thousands, who do also sit in idleness, while there are thousands round about in the borders of the land who are falling by the sword, yea, wounded and bleeding?</li>
            <li id="alma_60.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while ye sit still and behold these things?  Behold I say unto you, Nay.  Now I would that ye should remember that God has said that the inward vessel shall be cleansed first, and then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, except ye do repent of that which ye have done, and begin to be up and doing, and send forth food and men unto us, and also unto Helaman, that he may support those parts of our country which he has regained, and that we may also recover the remainder of our possessions in these parts, behold it will be expedient that we contend no more with the Lamanites until we have first cleansed our inward vessel, yea, even the great head of our government.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto me a true spirit of freedom, and strive to strengthen and fortify our armies, and grant unto them food for their support, behold I will leave a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our land, and I will leave the strength and the blessings of God upon them, that none other power can operate against them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_60.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And this because of their exceeding faith, and their patience in their tribulations&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_60.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And I will come unto you, and if there be any among you that has a desire for freedom, yea, if there be even a spark of freedom remaining, behold I will stir up insurrections among you, even until those who have desires to usurp power and authority shall become extinct.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Yea, behold I do not fear your power nor your authority, but it is my God whom I fear; and it is according to his commandments that I do take my sword to defend the cause of my country, and it is because of your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that except ye do bestir yourselves in the defence of your country and your little ones, the sword of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it shall fall upon you and visit you even to your utter destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, except ye do administer unto our relief, behold, I come unto you, even in the land of Zarahemla, and smite you with the sword, insomuch that ye can have no more power to impede the progress of this people in the cause of our freedom.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For behold, the Lord will not suffer that ye shall live and wax strong in your iniquities to destroy his righteous people.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Behold, can you suppose that the Lord will spare you and come out in judgment against the Lamanites, when it is the tradition of their fathers that has caused their hatred, yea, and it has been redoubled by those who have dissented from us, while your iniquity is for the cause of your love of glory and the vain things of the world?</li>
            <li id="alma_60.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know that ye do trample them under your feet.  Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And now behold, I, Moroni, am constrained, according to the covenant which I have made to keep the commandments of my God; therefore I would that ye should adhere to the word of God, and send speedily unto me of your provisions and of your men, and also to Helaman.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And behold, if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily; for behold, God will not suffer that we should perish with hunger; therefore he will give unto us of your food, even if it must be by the sword.  Now see that ye fulfil the word of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_60.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain.  I seek not for power, but to pull it down.  I seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my country.  And thus I close mine epistle.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_62.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle his heart did take courage, and was filled with exceedingly great joy because of the faithfulness of Pahoran, that he was not also a traitor to the freedom and cause of his country.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But he did also mourn exceedingly because of the iniquity of those who had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine because of those who had rebelled against their country and also their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men, according to the desire of Pahoran, and gave Lehi and Teancum command over the remainder of his army, and took his march towards the land of Gideon.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he did raise the standard of liberty in whatsoever place he did enter, and gained whatsoever force he could in all his march towards the land of Gideon.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that thousands did flock unto his standard, and did take up their swords in the defence of their freedom, that they might not come into bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he could in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his forces with those of Pahoran they became exceedingly strong, even stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the king of those dissenters who had driven the freemen out of the land of Zarahemla and had taken possession of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran went down with their armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the city, and did meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did come to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners, and Pahoran was restored to his judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also those king-men who had been taken and cast into prison; and they were executed according to the law; yea, those men of Pachus and those king-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country, but would fight against it, were put to death.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly observed for the safety of their country; yea, and whosoever was found denying their freedom was speedily executed according to the law.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; Moroni and Pahoran having restored peace to the land of Zarahemla, among their own people, having inflicted death upon all those who were not true to the cause of freedom.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni immediately caused that provisions should be sent, and also an army of six thousand men should be sent unto Helaman, to assist him in preserving that part of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And he also caused that an army of six thousand men, with a sufficient quantity of food, should be sent to the armies of Lehi and Teancum.  And it came to pass that this was done to fortify the land against the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a large body of men in the land of Zarahemla, took their march with a large body of men towards the land of Nephihah, being determined to overthrow the Lamanites in that city.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that as they were marching towards the land, they took a large body of men of the Lamanites, and slew many of them, and took their provisions and their weapons of war.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass after they had taken them, they caused them to enter into a covenant that they would no more take up their weapons of war against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And when they had entered into this covenant they sent them to dwell with the people of Ammon, and they were in number about four thousand who had not been slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they pursued their march towards the land of Nephihah.  And it came to pass that when they had come to the city of Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which is near the city of Nephihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to battle against them, upon the plains; but the Lamanites, knowing of their exceedingly great courage, and beholding the greatness of their numbers, therefore they durst not come out against them; therefore they did not come to battle in that day.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And when the night came, Moroni went forth in the darkness of the night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the city the Lamanites did camp with their army.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that they were on the east, by the entrance; and they were all asleep.  And now Moroni returned to his army, and caused that they should prepare in haste strong cords and ladders, to be let down from the top of the wall into the inner part of the wall.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men should march forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves down into that part of the city, yea, even on the west, where the Lamanites did not camp with their armies.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city by night, by the means of their strong cords and their ladders; thus when the morning came they were all within the walls of the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, when the Lamanites awoke and saw that the armies of Moroni were within the walls, they were affrighted exceedingly, insomuch that they did flee out by the pass.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he did cause that his men should march forth against them, and slew many, and surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and the remainder of them fled into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Thus had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the possession of the city of Nephihah without the loss of one soul; and there were many of the Lamanites who were slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now it came to pass that many of the Lamanites that were prisoners were desirous to join the people of Ammon and become a free people.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that as many as were desirous, unto them it was granted according to their desires.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore, all the prisoners of the Lamanites did join the people of Ammon, and did begin to labor exceedingly, tilling the ground, raising all manner of grain, and flocks and herds of every kind; and thus were the Nephites relieved from a great burden; yea, insomuch that they were relieved from all the prisoners of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Now it came to pass that Moroni, after he had obtained possession of the city of Nephihah, having taken many prisoners, which did reduce the armies of the Lamanites exceedingly, and having regained many of the Nephites who had been taken prisoners, which did strengthen the army of Moroni exceedingly; therefore Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land of Lehi.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Moroni was coming against them, they were again frightened and fled before the army of Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that Moroni and his army did pursue them from city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the Lamanites fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the borders by the seashore, until they came to the land of Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, insomuch that they were all in one body in the land of Moroni.  Now Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Moroni and Lehi and Teancum did encamp with their armies round about in the borders of the land of Moroni, insomuch that the Lamanites were encircled about in the borders by the wilderness on the south, and in the borders by the wilderness on the east.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And thus they did encamp for the night.  For behold, the Nephites and the Lamanites also were weary because of the greatness of the march; therefore they did not resolve upon any stratagem in the night-time, save it were Teancum; for he was exceedingly angry with Ammoron, insomuch that he considered that Ammoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been the cause of this great and lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had been the cause of so much war and bloodshed, yea, and so much famine.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that Teancum in his anger did go forth into the camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the walls of the city.  And he went forth with a cord, from place to place, insomuch that he did find the king; and he did cast a javelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart.  But behold, the king did awaken his servants before he died, insomuch that they did pursue Teancum, and slew him.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who had fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions.  But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Now it came to pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow, and came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them with a great slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land; and they did flee, even that they did not return at that time against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And thus ended the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and thus they had had wars, and bloodsheds, and famine, and affliction, for the space of many years.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And there had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions, and all manner of iniquity among the people of Nephi; nevertheless for the righteous&#x2019; sake, yea, because of the prayers of the righteous, they were spared.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> But behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the war between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And it came to pass that after Moroni had fortified those parts of the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites, until they were sufficiently strong, he returned to the city of Zarahemla; and also Helaman returned to the place of his inheritance; and there was once more peace established among the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And Moroni yielded up the command of his armies into the hands of his son, whose name was Moronihah; and he retired to his own house that he might spend the remainder of his days in peace.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> And Pahoran did return to his judgment-seat; and Helaman did take upon him again to preach unto the people the word of God; for because of so many wars and contentions it had become expedient that a regulation should be made again in the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth, and did declare the word of God with much power unto the convincing of many people of their wickedness, which did cause them to repent of their sins and to be baptized unto the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And it came to pass that they did establish again the church of God, throughout all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> Yea, and regulations were made concerning the law.  And their judges, and their chief judges were chosen.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> And the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to multiply and to wax exceedingly strong again in the land.  And they began to grow exceedingly rich.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their prosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of their eyes; neither were they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they did humble themselves exceedingly before him.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for them, that he had delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and from all manner of afflictions, and he had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And they did pray unto the Lord their God continually, insomuch that the Lord did bless them, according to his word, so that they did wax strong and prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_62.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> And it came to pass that all these things were done.  And Helaman died, in the thirty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year there were many dissensions in the church, and there was also a contention among the people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and they did go unto the king of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the Lamanites to war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites were exceedingly afraid, insomuch that they would not hearken to the words of those dissenters.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, there were dissenters who went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And in the fifty and seventh year they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in obtaining possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the Nephites and the armies of Moronihah were driven even into the land of Bountiful;</li>
            <li id="hel_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the west sea, even unto the east; it being a day&#x2019;s journey for a Nephite, on the line which they had fortified and stationed their armies to defend their north country.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a numerous army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession of the Nephites which was in the land southward.  And all this was done in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the reign of the judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies in obtaining many parts of the land; yea, they regained many cities which had fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass in the sixty and first year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in regaining even the half of all their possessions.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, would not have happened had it not been for their wickedness and their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among those also who professed to belong to the church of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering, lying, stealing, committing adultery, rising up in great contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the Lamanites&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost all their lands.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people because of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, who were the sons of Helaman, did preach many things unto the people, yea, and did prophesy many things unto them concerning their iniquities, and what should come unto them if they did not repent of their sins.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did repent they did begin to prosper.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For when Moronihah saw that they did repent he did venture to lead them forth from place to place, and from city to city, even until they had regained the one-half of their property and the one-half of all their lands.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass in the sixty and second year of the reign of the judges, that Moronihah could obtain no more possessions over the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the remainder of their lands, for so numerous were the Lamanites that it became impossible for the Nephites to obtain more power over them; therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in maintaining those parts which he had taken.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass, because of the greatness of the number of the Lamanites the Nephites were in great fear, lest they should be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also the words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a stiffnecked people, and that they had set at naught the commandments of God;</li>
            <li id="hel_4.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And that they had altered and trampled under their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and they saw that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And because of their iniquity the church had begun to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_4.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were exceedingly more numerous than they, and except they should cleave unto the Lord their God they must unavoidably perish.</li>
            <li id="hel_4.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great as their strength, even man for man.  And thus had they fallen into this great transgression; yea, thus had they become weak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many years.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the forty and third year of the reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And there was no contention among the people in the forty and fourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth year.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea, there was much contention and many dissensions; in the which there were an exceedingly great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land northward to inherit the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they did travel to an exceedingly great distance, insomuch that they came to large bodies of water and many rivers.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate and without timber, because of the many inhabitants who had before inherited the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber; but because of the greatness of the destruction of the people who had before inhabited the land it was called desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there being but little timber upon the face of the land, nevertheless the people who went forth became exceedingly expert in the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to the sea east.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the people who were in the land northward did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should grow up, that in time they might have timber to build their houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their buildings.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass as timber was exceedingly scarce in the land northward, they did send forth much by the way of shipping.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus they did enable the people in the land northward that they might build many cities, both of wood and of cement.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that there were many of the people of Ammon, who were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now there are many records kept of the proceedings of this people, by many of this people, which are particular and very large, concerning them.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions, and dissensions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping and their building of ships, and their building of temples, and of synagogues and their sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and their wickedness, and their murders, and their robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But behold, there are many books and many records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And they have been handed down from one generation to another by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now I return again to mine account; therefore, what I have spoken had passed after there had been great contentions, and disturbances, and wars, and dissensions, among the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended;</li>
            <li id="hel_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that there was still great contention in the land, yea, even in the forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that he had two sons.  He gave unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of Lehi.  And they began to grow up unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to cease, in a small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the robber had established in the more settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those who were at the head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that in this same year there was exceedingly great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there were thousands who did join themselves unto the church and were baptized unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even the high priests and the teachers were themselves astonished beyond measure.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper unto the baptizing and uniting to the church of God, many souls, yea, even tens of thousands.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_3.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And in this year there was continual rejoicing in the land of Zarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that there was peace and exceedingly great joy in the remainder of the forty and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual peace and great joy in the fiftieth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the judges there was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter into the church&#x2014;not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_3.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And they were lifted up in pride, even to the persecution of many of their brethren.  Now this was a great evil, which did cause the more humble part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much affliction.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceedingly great pride which had gotten into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.</li>
            <li id="hel_3.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass in the fifty and third year of the reign of the judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead.

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_63.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Shiblon took possession of those sacred things which had been delivered unto Helaman by Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And he was a just man, and he did walk uprightly before God; and he did observe to do good continually, to keep the commandments of the Lord his God; and also did his brother.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that Moroni died also.  And thus ended the thirty and sixth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that in the thirty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, there was a large company of men, even to the amount of five thousand and four hundred men, with their wives and their children, departed out of the land of Zarahemla into the land which was northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and children; and they took their course northward.  And thus ended the thirty and seventh year.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships.  And the first ship did also return, and many more people did enter into it; and they also took much provisions, and set out again to the land northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that they were never heard of more.  And we suppose that they were drowned in the depths of the sea.  And it came to pass that one other ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go we know not.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that in this year there were many people who went forth into the land northward.  And thus ended the thirty and eighth year.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, Shiblon died also, and Corianton had gone forth to the land northward in a ship, to carry forth provisions unto the people who had gone forth into that land.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore it became expedient for Shiblon to confer those sacred things, before his death, upon the son of Helaman, who was called Helaman, being called after the name of his father.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now behold, all those engravings which were in the possession of Helaman were written and sent forth among the children of men throughout all the land, save it were those parts which had been commanded by Alma should not go forth.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless, these things were to be kept sacred, and handed down from one generation to another; therefore, in this year, they had been conferred upon Helaman, before the death of Shiblon.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass also in this year that there were some dissenters who had gone forth unto the Lamanites; and they were stirred up again to anger against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And also in this same year they came down with a numerous army to war against the people of Moronihah, or against the army of Moronihah, in the which they were beaten and driven back again to their own lands, suffering great loss.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus ended the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_63.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus ended the account of Alma, and Helaman his son, and also Shiblon, who was his son.</li>

            <li id="hel_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi delivered up the judgment-seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For as their laws and their governments were established by the voice of the people, and they who chose evil were more numerous than they who chose good, therefore they were ripening for destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, and this was not all; they were a stiffnecked people, insomuch that they could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary because of their iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment-seat, and took it upon him to preach the word of God all the remainder of his days, and his brother Lehi also, all the remainder of his days;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto them.  And these are the words which he spake:</li>
            <li id="hel_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words.  Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the city of Ammonihah; for he said unto him that the Lord surely should come to redeem his people, but that he should not come to redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them from their sins because of repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which are written.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And from thenceforth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid to the city of Mulek;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And even from one city to another, until they had gone forth among all the people of Nephi who were in the land southward; and from thence into the land of Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that they did preach with great power, insomuch that they did confound many of those dissenters who had gone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance, and immediately returned to the Nephites to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak, and they also had what they should speak given unto them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and round about baptized unto repentance, and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the Lamanites and cast into prison; yea, even in that same prison in which Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And after they had been cast into prison many days without food, behold, they went forth into the prison to take them that they might slay them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear lest they should be burned.  Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not burned.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And when they saw that they were encircled about with a pillar of fire, and that it burned them not, their hearts did take courage.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands upon them; neither durst they come near unto them, but stood as if they were struck dumb with amazement.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth and began to speak unto them, saying: Fear not, for behold, it is God that has shown unto you this marvelous thing, in the which is shown unto you that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And behold, when they had said these words, the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison did shake as if they were about to tumble to the earth; but behold, they did not fall.  And behold, they that were in the prison were Lamanites and Nephites who were dissenters.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud of darkness, and an awful solemn fear came upon them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that there came a voice as if it were above the cloud of darkness, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to destroy my servants whom I have sent unto you to declare good tidings.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And notwithstanding the mildness of the voice, behold the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison trembled again, as if it were about to tumble to the earth; and behold the cloud of darkness, which had overshadowed them, did not disperse&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_5.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And behold the voice came again, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and seek no more to destroy my servants.  And it came to pass that the earth shook again, and the walls trembled.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And also again the third time the voice came, and did speak unto them marvelous words which cannot be uttered by man; and the walls did tremble again, and the earth shook as if it were about to divide asunder.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee because of the cloud of darkness which did overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable because of the fear which did come upon them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Now there was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who had once belonged to the church of God but had dissented from them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw through the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did shine exceedingly, even as the faces of angels.  And he beheld that they did lift their eyes to heaven; and they were in the attitude as if talking or lifting their voices to some being whom they beheld.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude, that they might turn and look.  And behold, there was power given unto them that they did turn and look; and they did behold the faces of Nephi and Lehi.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And they said unto the man: Behold, what do all these things mean, and who is it with whom these men do converse?</li>
            <li id="hel_5.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Now the man&#x2019;s name was Aminadab.  And Aminadab said unto them: They do converse with the angels of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?</li>
            <li id="hel_5.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And Aminadab said unto them: You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the voice of him who had shaken the earth; yea, they did cry even until the cloud of darkness was dispersed.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and saw that the cloud of darkness was dispersed from overshadowing them, behold, they saw that they were encircled about, yea every soul, by a pillar of fire.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> And Nephi and Lehi were in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison; and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And behold, the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and did enter into their hearts, and they were filled as if with fire, and they could speak forth marvelous words.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And it came to pass that there came a voice unto them, yea, a pleasant voice, as if it were a whisper, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_5.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my Well Beloved, who was from the foundation of the world.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> And now, when they heard this they cast up their eyes as if to behold from whence the voice came; and behold, they saw the heavens open; and angels came down out of heaven and ministered unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And there were about three hundred souls who saw and heard these things; and they were bidden to go forth and marvel not, neither should they doubt.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> And it came to pass that they did go forth, and did minister unto the people, declaring throughout all the regions round about all the things which they had heard and seen, insomuch that the more part of the Lamanites were convinced of them, because of the greatness of the evidences which they had received.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And as many as were convinced did lay down their weapons of war, and also their hatred and the tradition of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="hel_5.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> And it came to pass that they did yield up unto the Nephites the lands of their possession.</li>

            <li id="hel_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, there were many of the Nephites who had become hardened and impenitent and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of God and all the preaching and prophesying which did come among them.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy because of the conversion of the Lamanites, yea, because of the church of God, which had been established among them.

            <li id="hel_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and many did preach with exceedingly great power and authority, unto the bringing down many of them into the depths of humility, to be the humble followers of God and the Lamb.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did go into the land northward; and also Nephi and Lehi went into the land northward, to preach unto the people.  And thus ended the sixty and third year.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, there was peace in all the land, insomuch that the Nephites did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether among the Nephites or the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go whithersoever they would, whether it were among the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus they did have free intercourse one with another, to buy and to sell, and to get gain, according to their desire.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they became exceedingly rich, both the Lamanites and the Nephites; and they did have an exceeding plenty of gold, and of silver, and of all manner of precious metals, both in the land south and in the land north.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now the land south was called Lehi, and the land north was called Mulek, which was after the son of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land south.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, there was all manner of gold in both these lands, and of silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there were also curious workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and did refine it; and thus they did become rich.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in the south; and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north and in the south.  And they did multiply and wax exceedingly strong in the land.  And they did raise many flocks and herds, yea, many fatlings.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold their women did toil and spin, and did make all manner of cloth, of fine-twined linen and cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness.  And thus the sixty and fourth year did pass away in peace.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And in the sixty and fifth year they did also have great joy and peace, yea, much preaching and many prophecies concerning that which was to come.  And thus passed away the sixty and fifth year.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that in the sixty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, behold, Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand as he sat upon the judgment-seat.  And it came to pass that in the same year, that his son, who had been appointed by the people in his stead, was also murdered.  And thus ended the sixty and sixth year.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And in the commencement of the sixty and seventh year the people began to grow exceedingly wicked again.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches of the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodshed; therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit secret murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they might get gain.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band who had been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton.  And now it had come to pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton&#x2019;s band.  But behold, they were more numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites.  And they were called Gadianton&#x2019;s robbers and murderers.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it was they who did murder the chief judge Cezoram, and his son, while in the judgment-seat; and behold, they were not found.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that there were robbers among them they were exceedingly sorrowful; and they did use every means in their power to destroy them off the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more part of the Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter into their covenants and their oaths, that they would protect and preserve one another in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be placed, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their stealings.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And whosoever of those who belonged to their band should reveal unto the world of their wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not according to the laws of their country, but according to the laws of their wickedness, which had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now behold, it is these secret oaths and covenants which Alma commanded his son should not go forth unto the world, lest they should be a means of bringing down the people unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, they were put into the heart of Gadianton by that same being who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_6.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, that same being who did plot with Cain, that if he would murder his brother Abel it should not be known unto the world.  And he did plot with Cain and his followers from that time forth.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven.  And it was that same being who led on the people who came from that tower into this land; who spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of Gadianton to still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he has brought it forth from the beginning of man even down to this time.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And behold, it is he who is the author of all sin.  And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the way of righteousness, and did trample under their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto themselves idols of their gold and their silver.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years, insomuch that a more part of it had come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And they did grow in their iniquities in the sixty and eighth year also, to the great sorrow and lamentation of the righteous.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among the more wicked part of them, insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly destroyed from among the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did build them up and support them, beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they had overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of the righteous until they had come down to believe in their works and partake of their spoils, and to join with them in their secret murders and combinations.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government, insomuch that they did trample under their feet and smite and rend and turn their backs upon the poor and the meek, and the humble followers of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And thus we see that they were in an awful state, and ripening for an everlasting destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_6.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass in the sixty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla from the land northward.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For he had been forth among the people who were in the land northward, and did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto them;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they did reject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among them, but returned again unto the land of his nativity.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the judgment-seats&#x2014;having usurped the power and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:</li>
            <li id="hel_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall be filled with sorrow because of this the wickedness of my brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by which led the highway.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower; and they ran and told the people what they had seen, and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people who had gathered together.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them: Behold, why have ye gathered yourselves together?  That I may tell you of your iniquities?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon your hearts.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, how could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> O repent ye, repent ye!  Why will ye die?  Turn ye, turn ye unto the Lord your God.  Why has he forsaken you?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him to anger against you.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye will repent, behold, he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> O, how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he has delivered you?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver.  And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent.  For if ye will not repent, behold, this great city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words. Now therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination which has come among you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea, to that secret band which was established by Gadianton!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Yea, wo shall come unto you because of that pride which ye have suffered to enter your hearts, which has lifted you up beyond that which is good because of your exceedingly great riches!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and abominations!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And except ye repent ye shall perish; yea, even your lands shall be taken from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Behold now, I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but behold, I know that these things are true because the Lord God has made them known unto me, therefore I testify that they shall be.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these words, certain men who were among them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, even there were five who went, and they said among themselves, as they went:</li>
            <li id="hel_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Behold, now we will know of a surety whether this man be a prophet and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous things unto us.  Behold, we do not believe that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that he be dead, then will we believe that the other words which he has spoken are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto the judgment-seat; and behold, the chief judge had fallen to the earth, and did lie in his blood.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now behold, when they saw this they were astonished exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not believed the words which Nephi had spoken concerning the chief judge.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them lest all the judgments which Nephi had spoken should come upon the people; therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, immediately when the judge had been murdered&#x2014;he being stabbed by his brother by a garb of secrecy, and he fled, and the servants ran and told the people, raising the cry of murder among them;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold the people did gather themselves together unto the place of the judgment-seat&#x2014;and behold, to their astonishment they saw those five men who had fallen to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the multitude who had gathered together at the garden of Nephi; therefore they said among themselves: These men are they who have murdered the judge, and God has smitten them that they could not flee from us.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound them and cast them into prison.  And there was a proclamation sent abroad that the judge was slain, and that the murderers had been taken and were cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow the people did assemble themselves together to mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great chief judge who had been slain.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus also those judges who were at the garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying: Where are the five who were sent to inquire concerning the chief judge whether he was dead?  And they answered and said: Concerning this five whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but there are five who are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the judges desired that they should be brought; and they were brought, and behold they were the five who were sent; and behold the judges inquired of them to know concerning the matter, and they told them all that they had done, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> We ran and came to the place of the judgment-seat, and when we saw all things even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished insomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast us into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now, as for the murder of this man, we know not who has done it; and only this much we know, we ran and came according as ye desired, and behold he was dead, according to the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold, we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the burial.  Nevertheless, they did rebuke the judges in the words which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways that they might cross him, that they might accuse him to death&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath done this murder?  Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault; saying, Behold here is money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement which thou hast made with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But Nephi said unto them: O ye fools, ye uncircumcised of heart, ye blind, and ye stiffnecked people, do ye know how long the Lord your God will suffer you that ye shall go on in this your way of sin?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> O ye ought to begin to howl and mourn, because of the great destruction which at this time doth await you, except ye shall repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Behold ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should murder Seezoram, our chief judge.  But behold, I say unto you, that this is because I have testified unto you that ye might know concerning this thing; yea, even for a witness unto you, that I did know of the wickedness and abominations which are among you.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And because I have done this, ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should do this thing; yea, because I showed unto you this sign ye are angry with me, and seek to destroy my life.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now behold, I will show unto you another sign, and see if ye will in this thing seek to destroy me.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold I say unto you: Go to the house of Seantum, who is the brother of Seezoram, and say unto him&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Has Nephi, the pretended prophet, who doth prophesy so much evil concerning this people, agreed with thee, in the which ye have murdered Seezoram, who is your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And behold, he shall say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And ye shall say unto him: Have ye murdered your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And he shall stand with fear, and wist not what to say.  And behold, he shall deny unto you; and he shall make as if he were astonished; nevertheless, he shall declare unto you that he is innocent.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But behold, ye shall examine him, and ye shall find blood upon the skirts of his cloak.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And when ye have seen this, ye shall say: From whence cometh this blood?  Do we not know that it is the blood of your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And then shall he tremble, and shall look pale, even as if death had come upon him.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And then shall ye say: Because of this fear and this paleness which has come upon your face, behold, we know that thou art guilty.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And then shall greater fear come upon him; and then shall he confess unto you, and deny no more that he has done this murder.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And then shall he say unto you, that I, Nephi, know nothing concerning the matter save it were given unto me by the power of God.  And then shall ye know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent unto you from God.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as Nephi had said unto them.  And behold, the words which he had said were true; for according to the words he did deny; and also according to the words he did confess.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And he was brought to prove that he himself was the very murderer, insomuch that the five were set at liberty, and also was Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And there were some of the Nephites who believed on the words of Nephi; and there were some also, who believed because of the testimony of the five, for they had been converted while they were in prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And now there were some among the people, who said that Nephi was a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And there were others who said: Behold, he is a god, for except he was a god he could not know of all things.  For behold, he has told us the thoughts of our hearts, and also has told us things; and even he has brought unto our knowledge the true murderer of our chief judge.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold, there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he has done?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people and against our law?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And those judges were angry with him because he spake plainly unto them concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for they feared the people lest they should cry out against them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer this man to revile against us?  For behold he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are powerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no power over us.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to anger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities.  And behold they are many, and he knoweth as well all things which shall befall us as he knoweth of our iniquities;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified concerning those things.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying: Behold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swallowed them up?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great power given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God should come?  And as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up who should come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And as many as should look upon that serpent should live, even so as many as should look upon the Son of God with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with gladness and did rejoice.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were many before the days of Abraham who were called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days of Abraham there have been many prophets that have testified these things; yea, behold, the prophet Zenos did testify boldly; for the which he was slain.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet who testified of the destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed according to the words of Jeremiah.  O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed?  Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek?  Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem?  But behold, this is not all&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he testified of these things.  Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because of that which is to come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot deny them except ye shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many evidences which ye have received; yea, even ye have received all things, both things in heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as a witness that they are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because of your murders and your fornication and wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea, and except ye repent it will come unto you soon.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto the judgment-seat, and search; and behold, your judge is murdered, and he lieth in his blood; and he hath been murdered by his brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And behold, they both belong to your secret band, whose author is Gadianton and the evil one who seeketh to destroy the souls of men.</li>

            <li id="hel_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One&#x2014;yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!</li>
            <li id="hel_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom&#x2019;s paths!</li>
            <li id="hel_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God.</li>

            <li id="hel_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that in this year there was one Samuel, a Lamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people.  And it came to pass that he did preach, many days, repentance unto the people, and they did cast him out, and he was about to return to his own land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, that he should return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things should come into his heart.</li>

            <li id="hel_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people.</li>

            <li id="hel_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will withdraw my Spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And four hundred years shall not pass away before I will cause that they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword and with famine and with pestilence.</li>

            <li id="hel_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the earth shall find them again no more, because of the great curse of the land, save he be a righteous man and shall hide it up unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their treasures unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up their treasures unto me; for none hideth up their treasures unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasures unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because they have set their hearts upon riches; and because they have set their hearts upon their riches, and will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before their enemies; because they will not hide them up unto me, cursed be they and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my words; yea, hearken unto the words which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye are cursed because of your riches, and also are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon them, and have not hearkened unto the words of him who gave them unto you.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a curse should come upon the land, and also upon your riches, and this because of your iniquities.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arrived, that ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do slay them, and do all manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old time.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of our fathers of old, we would not have slain the prophets; we would not have stoned them, and cast them out.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a sinner, and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth&#x2014;and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he is a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh flattering words unto you, and he saith that all is well, then ye will not find fault with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you?  Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides?  Yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light?</li>
            <li id="hel_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you; behold, he hath cursed the land because of your iniquity.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that they become slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And in the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts.  And then shall ye lament, and say:</li>
            <li id="hel_13.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> O that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out.  Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and behold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought them for battle.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they have slipped away from us, because of the curse of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we cannot hold them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls.  Behold, our iniquities are great.  O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us?  And this shall be your language in those days.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words!  And I pray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be saved.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the reign of the judges that the contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land among all the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it was this secret band of robbers who did carry on this work of destruction and wickedness.  And this war did last all that year; and in the seventy and third year it did also last.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And so it was done, according to the words of Nephi.  And there was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi.  And thus in the seventy and fourth year the famine did continue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword but became sore by famine.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And this work of destruction did also continue in the seventy and fifth year.  For the earth was smitten that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their God; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the people began to plead with their chief judges and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that the judges did say unto Nephi, according to the words which had been desired.  And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that the people had repented and did humble themselves in sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them insomuch that they have become extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, O Lord, because of this their humility wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in the season of grain.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my words, for thou saidst that: If this people repent I will spare them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the famine and the pestilence and destruction which has come unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they will serve thee?  And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy words which thou hast said.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit.  And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did cover the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west to the sea east.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace.  And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by the prophets.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much strife.  But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain number who were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they became an exceedingly great band of robbers; and they did search out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into the wilderness and upon the mountains to search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> But behold, it came to pass that in that same year they were driven back even into their own lands.  And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first year they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and they were also visited with much destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness and out of the mountains unto their own lands, because of the exceeding greatness of the numbers of those robbers who infested the mountains and the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that thus ended this year.  And the robbers did still increase and wax strong, insomuch that they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come unto the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially their women and their children.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their iniquity, did stir them up again in remembrance of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And thus ended the eighty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And in the eighty and second year they began again to forget the Lord their God.  And in the eighty and third year they began to wax strong in iniquity.  And in the eighty and fourth year they did not mend their ways.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year they did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness; and thus they were ripening again for destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And thus ended the eighty and fifth year.</li>

            <li id="hel_14.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a great many more things which cannot be written.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And behold, he said unto them: Behold, I give unto you a sign; for five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all those who shall believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.</li>

            <li id="hel_14.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.</li>

            <li id="hel_14.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of his death.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death&#x2014;that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into the fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost there shall be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall shake and tremble; and the rocks which are upon the face of this earth, which are both above the earth and beneath, which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be found in seams and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth, yea, both above the earth and beneath.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places which are now called valleys which shall become mountains, whose height is great.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And behold, thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space of three days.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of this land, to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that there arose a division among the people, insomuch that they divided hither and thither and went their ways, leaving Nephi alone, as he was standing in the midst of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own house, pondering upon the things which the Lord had shown unto him.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass as he was thus pondering&#x2014;being much cast down because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, their secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of iniquities&#x2014;and it came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came unto him saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people.  And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God.  Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple it shall be rent in twain, it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, if ye shall say that God shall smite this people, it shall come to pass.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now behold, I command you, that ye shall go and declare unto this people, that thus saith the Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except ye repent ye shall be smitten, even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these words unto Nephi, he did stop and did not go unto his own house, but did return unto the multitudes who were scattered about upon the face of the land, and began to declare unto them the word of the Lord which had been spoken unto him, concerning their destruction if they did not repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now behold, notwithstanding that great miracle which Nephi had done in telling them concerning the death of the chief judge, they did harden their hearts and did not hearken unto the words of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Nephi did declare unto them the word of the Lord, saying: Except ye repent, thus saith the Lord, ye shall be smitten even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that when Nephi had declared unto them the word, behold, they did still harden their hearts and would not hearken unto his words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to lay their hands upon him that they might cast him into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not take him to cast him into prison, for he was taken by the Spirit and conveyed away out of the midst of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit, from multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words; and there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided against themselves and began to slay one another with the sword.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_52.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass in the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, behold, when the Lamanites awoke on the first morning of the first month, behold, they found Amalickiah was dead in his own tent; and they also saw that Teancum was ready to give them battle on that day.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and they abandoned their design in marching into the land northward, and retreated with all their army into the city of Mulek, and sought protection in their fortifications.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that the brother of Amalickiah was appointed king over the people; and his name was Ammoron; thus king Ammoron, the brother of king Amalickiah, was appointed to reign in his stead.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that he did command that his people should maintain those cities, which they had taken by the shedding of blood; for they had not taken any cities save they had lost much blood.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken, and those parts of the land which they had obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of their number, Teancum thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for war; yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself against them, by casting up walls round about and preparing places of resort.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that he kept thus preparing for war until Moroni had sent a large number of men to strengthen his army.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And Moroni also sent orders unto him that he should retain all the prisoners who fell into his hands; for as the Lamanites had taken many prisoners, that he should retain all the prisoners of the Lamanites as a ransom for those whom the Lamanites had taken.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he also sent orders unto him that he should fortify the land Bountiful, and secure the narrow pass which led into the land northward, lest the Lamanites should obtain that point and should have power to harass them on every side.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be faithful in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he would seek every opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that quarter, as much as was in his power, that perhaps he might take again by stratagem or some other way those cities which had been taken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify and strengthen the cities round about, which had not fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold, the Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the west sea; and behold, I go against them, therefore I cannot come unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now, the king (Ammoron) had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and had made known unto the queen concerning the death of his brother, and had gathered together a large number of men, and had marched forth against the Nephites on the borders by the west sea.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And thus he was endeavoring to harass the Nephites, and to draw away a part of their forces to that part of the land, while he had commanded those whom he had left to possess the cities which he had taken, that they should also harass the Nephites on the borders by the east sea, and should take possession of their lands as much as it was in their power, according to the power of their armies.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances in the ending of the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But behold, it came to pass in the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, that Teancum, by the command of Moroni&#x2014;who had established armies to protect the south and the west borders of the land, and had begun his march towards the land Bountiful, that he might assist Teancum with his men in retaking the cities which they had lost&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_52.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that Teancum had received orders to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were possible.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and march forth with his army against the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible that he could overpower them while they were in their fortifications; therefore he abandoned his designs and returned again to the city Bountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he might receive strength to his army.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Moroni did arrive with his army at the land of Bountiful, in the latter end of the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And in the commencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni and Teancum and many of the chief captains held a council of war&#x2014;what they should do to cause the Lamanites to come out against them to battle; or that they might by some means flatter them out of their strongholds, that they might gain advantage over them and take again the city of Mulek.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the Lamanites, which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out with his armies to meet them upon the plains between the two cities.  But behold, Jacob, who was a Zoramite, would not come out with his army to meet them upon the plains.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them upon fair grounds, therefore, he resolved upon a plan that he might decoy the Lamanites out of their strongholds.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men and march down near the seashore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites had discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, their leader.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the smallness of his numbers.  And as Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming out against him he began to retreat down by the seashore, northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that he began to flee, they took courage and pursued them with vigor.  And while Teancum was thus leading away the Lamanites who were pursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni commanded that a part of his army who were with him should march forth into the city, and take possession of it.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And thus they did, and slew all those who had been left to protect the city, yea, all those who would not yield up their weapons of war.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus Moroni had obtained possession of the city Mulek with a part of his army, while he marched with the remainder to meet the Lamanites when they should return from the pursuit of Teancum.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum until they came near the city Bountiful, and then they were met by Lehi and a small army, which had been left to protect the city Bountiful.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now behold, when the chief captains of the Lamanites had beheld Lehi with his army coming against them, they fled in much confusion, lest perhaps they should not obtain the city Mulek before Lehi should overtake them; for they were wearied because of their march, and the men of Lehi were fresh.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their rear with his army; and all they feared was Lehi and his men.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them till they should meet Moroni and his army.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that before the Lamanites had retreated far they were surrounded by the Nephites, by the men of Moroni on one hand, and the men of Lehi on the other, all of whom were fresh and full of strength; but the Lamanites were wearied because of their long march.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them until they had given up their weapons of war.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being also a Zoramite, and having an unconquerable spirit, he led the Lamanites forth to battle with exceeding fury against Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was determined to slay them and cut his way through to the city of Mulek.  But behold, Moroni and his men were more powerful; therefore they did not give way before the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that they fought on both hands with exceeding fury; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and Moroni was wounded and Jacob was killed.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his strong men, that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their weapons of war; and the remainder of them, being much confused, knew not whither to go or to strike.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Now Moroni seeing their confusion, he said unto them: If ye will bring forth your weapons of war and deliver them up, behold we will forbear shedding your blood.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had heard these words, their chief captains, all those who were not slain, came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and also commanded their men that they should do the same.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> But behold, there were many that would not; and those who would not deliver up their swords were taken and bound, and their weapons of war were taken from them, and they were compelled to march with their brethren forth into the land Bountiful.</li>
            <li id="alma_52.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And now the number of prisoners who were taken exceeded more than the number of those who had been slain, yea, more than those who had been slain on both sides.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_16.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city.  And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working miracles among the people, that they might know that the Christ must shortly come&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and remember at the time of their coming that they had been made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing their sins.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And thus ended also the eighty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges, there were great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the scriptures began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon their own strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot come to pass, of which has been spoken.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to reason and to contend among themselves, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself unto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, why will he not show himself in this land as well as in the land of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield ourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And many more things did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman and his sons.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my beloved brethren, behold, I declare unto you that except ye shall repent your houses shall be left unto you desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to mourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt to flee and there shall be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them which are with child, for they shall be heavy and cannot flee; therefore, they shall be trodden down and shall be left to perish.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, wo unto this people who are called the people of Nephi except they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated because their deeds have been evil continually, and this because of the iniquity of the tradition of their fathers.  But behold, salvation hath come unto them through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their days.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments according to the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they are striving with unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the truth; therefore there are many who do add to their numbers daily.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it, that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war, and they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin; yea, ye can see that they fear to sin&#x2014;for behold they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their enemies, and will not lift their swords against them, and this because of their faith in Christ.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, because of their steadfastness when they do believe in that thing which they do believe, for because of their firmness when they are once enlightened, behold, the Lord shall bless them and prolong their days, notwithstanding their iniquity&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief the Lord shall prolong their days, until the time shall come which hath been spoken of by our fathers, and also by the prophet Zenos, and many other prophets, concerning the restoration of our brethren, the Lamanites, again to the knowledge of the truth&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the promises of the Lord have been extended to our brethren, the Lamanites; and notwithstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and notwithstanding they shall be driven to and fro upon the face of the earth, and be hunted, and shall be smitten and scattered abroad, having no place for refuge, the Lord shall be merciful unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again be brought to the true knowledge, which is the knowledge of their Redeemer, and their great and true shepherd, and be numbered among his sheep.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore I say unto you, it shall be better for them than for you except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, had the mighty works been shown unto them which have been shown unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in unbelief because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see of yourselves that they never would again have dwindled in unbelief.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, saith the Lord: I will not utterly destroy them, but I will cause that in the day of my wisdom they shall return again unto me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the Nephites: If they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I will utterly destroy them, saith the Lord, because of their unbelief notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have done among them; and as surely as the Lord liveth shall these things be, saith the Lord.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 56</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_56.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the commencement of the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges, on the second day in the first month, Moroni received an epistle from Helaman, stating the affairs of the people in that quarter of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the tribulations of our warfare; behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you concerning our warfare in this part of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought down out of the land of Nephi&#x2014;now ye have known that these were descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our father Lehi;</li>
            <li id="alma_56.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or their unbelief, for thou knowest concerning all these things&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_56.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these young men have taken their weapons of war, and would that I should be their leader; and we have come forth to defend our country.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their fathers made, that they would not take up their weapons of war against their brethren to shed blood.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and our tribulations for them, they were about to break the covenant which they had made and take up their weapons of war in our defence.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But I would not suffer them that they should break this covenant which they had made, supposing that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we should not suffer more because of the fulfilling the oath which they had taken.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For behold, in the twenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of these two thousand young men to the city of Judea, to assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to be called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus did rejoice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to mourn.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they have died in the cause of their country and of their God, yea, and they are happy.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom are chief captains, for none other have they spared alive. And we suppose that they are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so if they are not slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men:</li>
            <li id="alma_56.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> The land of Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to fortify the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for they had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to maintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die; therefore you may well suppose that this little force which I brought with me, yea, those sons of mine, gave them great hopes and much joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a greater strength to his army, they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron to not come against the city of Judea, or against us, to battle.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us in this our weakness they might have perhaps destroyed our little army; but thus were we preserved.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which they had taken.  And thus ended the twenty and sixth year.  And in the commencement of the twenty and seventh year we had prepared our city and ourselves for defence.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for we were not desirous to make an attack upon them in their strongholds.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch the movements of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us by night nor by day to make an attack upon our other cities which were on the northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by us, to fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the same time they were met in the front.  We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were disappointed in this our desire.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong and they should fall.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was brought unto us many provisions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of Zarahemla.  And thus we were prepared with ten thousand men, and provisions for them, and also for their wives and their children.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and provisions arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and began to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our receiving provisions and strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise, we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them; therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth with my little sons to a neighboring city, as if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were going to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our provisions, to go to that city.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part of his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city.  But he did not march forth until I had gone forth with my little army, and came near the city Antiparah.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army of the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their spies, they came forth with their army and marched against us.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward.  And thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites;</li>
            <li id="alma_56.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this that they might not be surrounded by our people.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army.  But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the Lamanites were pursuing us.  Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it was dark.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning came we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they might catch us in their snare;</li>
            <li id="alma_56.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to battle?</li>
            <li id="alma_56.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army of Antipus.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand against these Lamanites who had pursued us.  And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, and a terrible battle had commenced.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they would have obtained their purpose.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march&#x2014;therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when Helaman came upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered together their men and came again upon the rear of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.55" class=""><span class="verse">55</span> And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered themselves up unto us, behold, I numbered those young men who had fought with me, fearing lest there were many of them slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.56" class=""><span class="verse">56</span> But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.</li>
            <li id="alma_56.57" class=""><span class="verse">57</span> And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard them to keep them from the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we sent them to the land of Zarahemla, and a part of those men who were not slain of Antipus, with them; and the remainder I took and joined them to my stripling Ammonites, and took our march back to the city of Judea.</li>

            <li id="alma_59.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, after Moroni had received and had read Helaman&#x2019;s epistle, he was exceedingly rejoiced because of the welfare, yea, the exceeding success which Helaman had had, in obtaining those lands which were lost.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, and he did make it known unto all his people, in all the land round about in that part where he was, that they might rejoice also.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that he immediately sent an epistle to Pahoran, desiring that he should cause men to be gathered together to strengthen Helaman, or the armies of Helaman, insomuch that he might with ease maintain that part of the land which he had been so miraculously prospered in regaining.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle to the land of Zarahemla, he began again to lay a plan that he might obtain the remainder of those possessions and cities which the Lamanites had taken from them.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus making preparations to go against the Lamanites to battle, behold, the people of Nephihah, who were gathered together from the city of Moroni and the city of Lehi and the city of Morianton, were attacked by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, even those who had been compelled to flee from the land of Manti, and from the land round about, had come over and joined the Lamanites in this part of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And thus being exceedingly numerous, yea, and receiving strength from day to day, by the command of Ammoron they came forth against the people of Nephihah, and they did begin to slay them with an exceedingly great slaughter.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And their armies were so numerous that the remainder of the people of Nephihah were obliged to flee before them; and they came even and joined the army of Moroni.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now as Moroni had supposed that there should be men sent to the city of Nephihah, to the assistance of the people to maintain that city, and knowing that it was easier to keep the city from falling into the hands of the Lamanites than to retake it from them, he supposed that they would easily maintain that city.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore he retained all his force to maintain those places which he had recovered.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now, when Moroni saw that the city of Nephihah was lost he was exceedingly sorrowful, and began to doubt, because of the wickedness of the people, whether they should not fall into the hands of their brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now this was the case with all his chief captains.  They doubted and marveled also because of the wickedness of the people, and this because of the success of the Lamanites over them.</li>
            <li id="alma_59.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country.</li>

It&#x2019;s true that we have our share of wars in the latter days, but there is value in his words beyond the descriptions of the strategy and tragedy of war. His words also prepare us for the war in which &#x201C;we are all enlisted&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/we-are-all-enlisted?lang=eng">no.&#xA0;250</a>), the war we are fighting each day against the forces of evil. This war is very real, and the outcome affects our eternal lives.

<p data-aid="154411370" id="p16">Do you want to lessen the power of the adversary in your life? One way is to follow the counsel in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17">Alma 48:17</a> to become &#x201C;like unto Moroni.&#x201D; Consider making a list of words that describe Moroni as you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p28#p11">Alma 46:11&#x2013;28</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48?lang=eng&amp;id=p7-p17#p7">48:7&#x2013;17</a>.

(<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&amp;id=p27#p27">Alma 46:27</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154411372" id="p17">You might also study how Moroni inspired others in &#x201C;the cause of the Christians&#x201D; (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p22#p11">Alma 46:11&#x2013;22</a>). How would you describe that cause? What can you do to participate in it? How can you inspire others to participate too?</p>
<p data-aid="154411373" id="p18">One thing Moroni did to inspire others was create the title of liberty, which emphasized principles to inspire the Nephites (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12">verse&#xA0;12</a>). What principles are our Church leaders emphasizing in our day?

<div class="body-block">
<p data-aid="154411053" id="p1">When compared with the Lamanite armies, Helaman&#x2019;s &#x201C;little army&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&amp;id=p33#p33">Alma 56:33</a>) of young men shouldn&#x2019;t have stood a chance. Besides being few in number, Helaman&#x2019;s soldiers &#x201C;were all &#x2026; very young,&#x201D; and &#x201C;they never had fought&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&amp;id=p46-p47#p46">Alma 56:46&#x2013;47</a>). In some ways, their situation might seem familiar to those of us who sometimes feel outnumbered and overwhelmed in our latter-day battle against Satan and the forces of evil in the world.</p>
<p data-aid="154411054" id="p2">But the army of Helaman had some advantages over the Lamanites that had nothing to do with numbers or military skill. They chose Helaman, a prophet, to lead them (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&amp;id=p19#p19">Alma 53:19</a>); &#x201C;they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&amp;id=p47#p47">Alma 56:47</a>); and they had &#x201C;exceeding faith in that which they had been taught.&#x201D; As a result, they were protected by &#x201C;the miraculous power of God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/57?lang=eng&amp;id=p26#p26">Alma 57:26</a>). So when facing life&#x2019;s battles, we can take courage.

As you read about them in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng">Alma 53&#x2013;58</a>, look for things that help you face your fears with faith in Christ.

<p data-aid="154411073" id="p11">Helaman and Pahoran had reasons to be offended. Helaman was not receiving support for his armies, and Pahoran was falsely accused by Moroni of withholding that support (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&amp;id=p4-p9,31-p32#p4">Alma 58:4&#x2013;9, 31&#x2013;32</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng">60</a>). What impresses you about their reactions in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p12,31-p37#p1">Alma 58:1&#x2013;12, 31&#x2013;37</a> and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/61?lang=eng">Alma&#xA0;61</a>? Why do you feel they responded this way?</p>
<p data-aid="154411074" id="p12">Elder David&#xA0;A. Bednar pointed to Pahoran as example of meekness and taught that &#x201C;the most majestic and meaningful examples of meekness are found in the life of the Savior Himself&#x201D; (&#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2018/04/meek-and-lowly-of-heart?lang=eng">Meek and Lowly of Heart</a>,&#x201D; <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, May 2018, 32). Ponder how the Savior showed meekness. See, for instance, <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p26#p11">Matthew 27:11&#x2013;26</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/luke/22?lang=eng&amp;id=p41-p42#p41">Luke 22:41&#x2013;42</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p4-p17#p4">John 13:4&#x2013;17</a>.

While your egg and potato are cooking, study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62?lang=eng&amp;id=p39-p51#p39">Alma 62:39&#x2013;51</a>, and notice how the people reacted to Helaman&#x2019;s ministry after their long war with the Lamanites. You could then compare this to how they had reacted to his preaching 13&#xA0;years earlier (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/45?lang=eng&amp;id=p20-p24#p20">Alma 45:20&#x2013;24</a>). How were the Nephites affected differently by the same afflictions? When the egg and potato are fully cooked, crack the egg and cut the potato. How did the boiling water affect them differently? What are you learning about how we can choose to react to affliction? How can you turn to God during your afflictions?</p>

<p data-aid="154410312" id="p1">Nephi&#x2019;s father, Helaman, had urged his sons to &#x201C;remember, remember.&#x201D; He wanted them to remember their ancestors, remember the words of the prophets, and most of all, remember &#x201C;our Redeemer, who is Christ&#x201D; (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p14#p5">Helaman 5:5&#x2013;14</a>). It&#x2019;s clear that Nephi did remember because this is the same message he declared years later &#x201C;with unwearyingness&#x201D; to the people (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p4#p4">Helaman 10:4</a>). &#x201C;How could you have forgotten your God?&#x201D; he asked (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p20#p20">Helaman 7:20</a>). All of Nephi&#x2019;s efforts&#x2014;preaching, praying, performing miracles, and petitioning God for a famine&#x2014;were attempts to help the people turn to God and remember Him. In many ways, forgetting God is an even bigger problem than not knowing Him. And it&#x2019;s easy to forget Him when our minds are distracted by &#x201C;the vain things of this world&#x201D; and clouded by sin (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p21#p21">Helaman 7:21</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Helaman 12:2</a>). But, as Nephi&#x2019;s ministry shows, it&#x2019;s never too late to remember and &#x201C;turn &#x2026; unto the Lord your God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17">Helaman 7:17</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154410461" id="p17">How do you remember important information&#x2014;like a family member&#x2019;s birthday or information for a test?

<p data-aid="154410468" id="p18"><a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng">Helaman&#xA0;12</a> describes several things that cause people to forget the Lord.

<p data-aid="154410521" id="p20">To start a conversation about remembering the Lord, you could tell your children about a time when you forgot something. Let them share similar experiences of their own. Then you could read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p20-p21#p20">Helaman 7:20&#x2013;21</a> and ask your children what they think it means to forget God. Maybe your children could draw pictures of things that could cause us to forget the Lord and use their drawings to cover a picture of Jesus. Then they could think of things they can do to remember Him. As they share their thoughts, they could take away the drawings one by one until the picture of the Savior is revealed.</p>

<p data-aid="154412105" id="p1">The book of Helaman records both triumphs and tragedies among the Nephites and Lamanites.

Here we read about political intrigue, bands of robbers, rejection of the prophets, and pride and disbelief throughout the land. But we also find examples like Nephi and Lehi and &#x201C;the more humble part of the people,&#x201D; who not only survived but thrived spiritually (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p34#p34">Helaman 3:34</a>). How did they do it? How did they stay strong while their civilization began to decline and fall apart? The same way any of us stay strong in the &#x201C;mighty storm&#x201D; the devil sends to &#x201C;beat upon [us]&#x201D;&#x2014;by building our lives &#x201C;upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, &#x2026; a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12">Helaman 5:12</a>).</p>

When they are righteous, God blesses them, and they prosper. After a time, they become prideful and wicked, making choices that lead to destruction and suffering. Then they are humbled and inspired to repent, and God blesses them once again. The pattern repeats itself so often that some call it the &#x201C;pride cycle.&#x201D;</p>

As you read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12">Helaman 5:12</a>, ask your children why Jesus Christ is &#x201C;a sure foundation&#x201D; for our lives.
