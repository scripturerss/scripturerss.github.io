        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman.  And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true.  And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of teaching his sons, that he waxed old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this people, whom the Lord our God hath given us.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out, except it be through transgression.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored people of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become weak like unto their brethren; and he will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of these sayings to his son, that he gave him charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the plates of Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor progress in their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his father had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the people who were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather themselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words which his father should speak unto them.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth.  And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak unto them, saying: My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my people, I would again call your attention, that ye may hear and understand the remainder of my words which I shall speak unto you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And this is the means whereby salvation cometh.  And there is none other salvation save this which hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions which I have told you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that which is his due.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For behold, are we not all beggars?  Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a remission of your sins.  And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain?  Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just will be your condemnation for withholding your substance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing which thou hast done.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall perish with him; and now, I say these things unto those who are rich as pertaining to the things of this world.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you&#x2014;that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God&#x2014;I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength.  And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_4.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish.  And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 8</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude, and rehearse unto them all that had happened unto their brethren from the time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time that he himself came up out of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king Benjamin had taught them, and explained them to the people of king Limhi, so that they might understand all the words which he spake.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return every one unto his own house.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the record of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could interpret languages, and Ammon told him that he could not.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are large, and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly sound.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again, they have brought swords, the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates.  Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate?  For I am desirous that these records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God.  And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the forest.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace.  And I caused that there should be weapons of war made of every kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our fathers for many years, yea, for the space of twenty and two years.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all manner of grain and all manner of fruit of every kind.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and cloth of every kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land&#x2014;thus we did have continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son began to reign in his stead.  And he began to stir his people up in rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to come up to battle against my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But I had sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon, that I might discover their preparations, that I might guard against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men armed with bows, and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle about their loins.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children of my people should be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place them in their ranks, every man according to his age.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that we did go up in the strength of the Lord to battle.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength.  Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this&#x2014;Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord&#x2014;therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And his brethren were wroth with him because they understood not the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And again, they were wroth with him when they had arrived in the promised land, because they said that he had taken the ruling of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into the wilderness as the Lord had commanded him, and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he robbed them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus they have taught their children that they should hate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy them; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our land; and we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not number them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that we returned again to our own land, and my people again began to tend their flocks, and to till their ground.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I, being old, did confer the kingdom upon one of my sons; therefore, I say no more.  And may the Lord bless my people.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_14.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation?  For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_14.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_17.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Abinadi had finished these sayings, that the king commanded that the priests should take him and cause that he should be put to death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But there was one among them whose name was Alma, he also being a descendant of Nephi.  And he was a young man, and he believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity which Abinadi had testified against them; therefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But the king was more wroth, and caused that Alma should be cast out from among them, and sent his servants after him that they might slay him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But he fled from before them and hid himself that they found him not.  And he being concealed for many days did write all the words which Abinadi had spoken.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards should surround Abinadi and take him; and they bound him and cast him into prison.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And after three days, having counseled with his priests, he caused that he should again be brought before him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I will not recall the words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are true; and that ye may know of their surety I have suffered myself that I have fallen into your hands.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you.  And if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his word; for he feared that the judgments of God would come upon him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But the priests lifted up their voices against him, and began to accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king.  Therefore the king was stirred up in anger against him, and he delivered him up that he might be slain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto them, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of death by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his people.  O God, receive my soul.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_16.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come when all shall see the salvation of the Lord; when every nation, kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall confess before God that his judgments are just.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And then shall the wicked be cast out, and they shall have cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and this because they would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first parents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause of all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing evil from good, subjecting themselves to the devil.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over him.  Therefore he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though they had already come, there could have been no redemption.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no sting, there could have been no resurrection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would not; they being warned of their iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to repent and yet they would not repent.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses, also teach that it is a shadow of those things which are to come&#x2014;</li>

            <li id="mosiah_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow they started to go up, having with them one Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man, and a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the wilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they wander.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when they had wandered forty days they came to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched their tents.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the land of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were surrounded by the king&#x2019;s guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were committed to prison.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were again brought before the king, and their bands were loosed; and they stood before the king, and were permitted, or rather commanded, that they should answer the questions which he should ask them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have caused that my guards should have put you to death.  Ye are permitted to speak.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he went forth and bowed himself before the king; and rising again he said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am yet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to speak with boldness;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these bands.  For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive.  And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne.  And now, behold, our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon nor his brethren, but caused that they should go to the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest themselves from the labors of their journey; for they had suffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather themselves together to the temple, to hear the words which he should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves together that he spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be made.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even until now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection or into bondage.  And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, is not this grievous to be borne?  And is not this, our affliction, great?  Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon them.  But behold, they would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among them, even so much that they did shed blood among themselves.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and said that he should take upon him the image of man, and it should be the image after which man was created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was created after the image of God, and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and many more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God upon them.  Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And again, he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the chaff thereof in the whirlwind; and the effect thereof is poison.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And again he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are smitten and afflicted.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God.  And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he stood before me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against God!  For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he had already come among them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing except it were through the atonement of his blood.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And even if it were possible that little children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come when the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And behold, when that time cometh, none shall be found blameless before God, except it be little children, only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And even at this time, when thou shalt have taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, even then are they found no more blameless in the sight of God, only according to the words which I have spoken unto thee.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath commanded me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright testimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof they shall be judged, every man according to his works, whether they be good, or whether they be evil.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have drunk damnation to their own souls.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have claim on them no more forever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_3.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever.  Thus hath the Lord commanded me.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the land, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And there were a great number, even so many that they did not number them; for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they also took of the firstlings of their flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the law of Moses;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had appointed just men to be their teachers, and also a just man to be their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the commandments of God, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For the multitude being so great that king Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of the temple, therefore he caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that he began to speak to his people from the tower; and they could not all hear his words because of the greatness of the multitude; therefore he caused that the words which he spake should be written and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also receive his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And these are the words which he spake and caused to be written, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne&#x2014;and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might boast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can answer a clear conscience before God this day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to serve one another?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king, who has spent his days in your service, and yet has been in the service of God, do merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your heavenly King!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another&#x2014;I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you.  And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves?  I answer you, Nay.  Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust.  And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done.  As ye have kept my commandments, and also the commandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are; and also have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom&#x2019;s paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_2.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.  For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.  O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_19.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that the army of the king returned, having searched in vain for the people of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now behold, the forces of the king were small, having been reduced, and there began to be a division among the remainder of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the lesser part began to breathe out threatenings against the king, and there began to be a great contention among them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now there was a man among them whose name was Gideon, and he being a strong man and an enemy to the king, therefore he drew his sword, and swore in his wrath that he would slay the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he fought with the king; and when the king saw that he was about to overpower him, he fled and ran and got upon the tower which was near the temple.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And Gideon pursued after him and was about to get upon the tower to slay the king, and the king cast his eyes round about towards the land of Shemlon, and behold, the army of the Lamanites were within the borders of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now the king cried out in the anguish of his soul, saying: Gideon, spare me, for the Lamanites are upon us, and they will destroy us; yea, they will destroy my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now the king was not so much concerned about his people as he was about his own life; nevertheless, Gideon did spare his life.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the king commanded the people that they should flee before the Lamanites, and he himself did go before them, and they did flee into the wilderness, with their women and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue them, and did overtake them, and began to slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now it came to pass that the king commanded them that all the men should leave their wives and their children, and flee before the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now there were many that would not leave them, but had rather stay and perish with them.  And the rest left their wives and their children and fled.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that those who tarried with their wives and their children caused that their fair daughters should stand forth and plead with the Lamanites that they would not slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites had compassion on them, for they were charmed with the beauty of their women.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Therefore the Lamanites did spare their lives, and took them captives and carried them back to the land of Nephi, and granted unto them that they might possess the land, under the conditions that they would deliver up king Noah into the hands of the Lamanites, and deliver up their property, even one half of all they possessed, one half of their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and thus they should pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites from year to year.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now there was one of the sons of the king among those that were taken captive, whose name was Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now Limhi was desirous that his father should not be destroyed; nevertheless, Limhi was not ignorant of the iniquities of his father, he himself being a just man.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Gideon sent men into the wilderness secretly, to search for the king and those that were with him. And it came to pass that they met the people in the wilderness, all save the king and his priests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now they had sworn in their hearts that they would return to the land of Nephi, and if their wives and their children were slain, and also those that had tarried with them, that they would seek revenge, and also perish with them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the king commanded them that they should not return; and they were angry with the king, and caused that he should suffer, even unto death by fire.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they were about to take the priests also and put them to death, and they fled before them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that they were about to return to the land of Nephi, and they met the men of Gideon.  And the men of Gideon told them of all that had happened to their wives and their children; and that the Lamanites had granted unto them that they might possess the land by paying a tribute to the Lamanites of one half of all they possessed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the people told the men of Gideon that they had slain the king, and his priests had fled from them farther into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that after they had ended the ceremony, that they returned to the land of Nephi, rejoicing, because their wives and their children were not slain; and they told Gideon what they had done to the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites made an oath unto them, that his people should not slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And also Limhi, being the son of the king, having the kingdom conferred upon him by the people, made oath unto the king of the Lamanites that his people should pay tribute unto him, even one half of all they possessed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that Limhi began to establish the kingdom and to establish peace among his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And the king of the Lamanites set guards round about the land, that he might keep the people of Limhi in the land, that they might not depart into the wilderness; and he did support his guards out of the tribute which he did receive from the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now king Limhi did have continual peace in his kingdom for the space of two years, that the Lamanites did not molest them nor seek to destroy them.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it were little children, but who had entered into the covenant and had taken upon them the name of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had consecrated his son Mosiah to be a ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the charges concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to teach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God, and to stir them up in remembrance of the oath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they returned, every one, according to their families, to their own houses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And Mosiah began to reign in his father&#x2019;s stead.  And he began to reign in the thirtieth year of his age, making in the whole, about four hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And king Benjamin lived three years and he died.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did keep his commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_20.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now there was a place in Shemlon where the daughters of the Lamanites did gather themselves together to sing, and to dance, and to make themselves merry.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that there was one day a small number of them gathered together to sing and to dance.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now the priests of king Noah, being ashamed to return to the city of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that the people would slay them, therefore they durst not return to their wives and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And having tarried in the wilderness, and having discovered the daughters of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when there were but few of them gathered together to dance, they came forth out of their secret places and took them and carried them into the wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the daughters of the Lamanites they carried into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that their daughters had been missing, they were angry with the people of Limhi, for they thought it was the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea, even the king himself went before his people; and they went up to the land of Nephi to destroy the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now Limhi had discovered them from the tower, even all their preparations for war did he discover; therefore he gathered his people together, and laid wait for them in the fields and in the forests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had come up, that the people of Limhi began to fall upon them from their waiting places, and began to slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the battle became exceedingly sore, for they fought like lions for their prey.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as the Lamanites.  But they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites among the number of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him before Limhi, and said: Behold, here is the king of the Lamanites; he having received a wound has fallen among their dead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him before you; and now let us slay him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring him hither that I may see him.  And they brought him.  And Limhi said unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my people?  Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now the king said: I have broken the oath because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter; therefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever has done this thing shall perish.  Therefore he caused a search to be made among his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now when Gideon had heard these things, he being the king&#x2019;s captain, he went forth and said unto the king: I pray thee forbear, and do not search this people, and lay not this thing to their charge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, whom this people sought to destroy?  And are they not in the wilderness?  And are not they the ones who have stolen the daughters of the Lamanites?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, behold, and tell the king of these things, that he may tell his people that they may be pacified towards us; for behold they are already preparing to come against us; and behold also there are but few of us.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, they come with their numerous hosts; and except the king doth pacify them towards us we must perish.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled, which he prophesied against us&#x2014;and all this because we would not hearken unto the words of the Lord, and turn from our iniquities?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil the oath which we have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in bondage than that we should lose our lives; therefore, let us put a stop to the shedding of so much blood.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now Limhi told the king all the things concerning his father, and the priests that had fled into the wilderness, and attributed the carrying away of their daughters to them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that the king was pacified towards his people; and he said unto them: Let us go forth to meet my people, without arms; and I swear unto you with an oath that my people shall not slay thy people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went forth without arms to meet the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites did bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi, that they were without arms, they had compassion on them and were pacified towards them, and returned with their king in peace to their own land.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart.  And he had many wives and concubines.  And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord.  Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a fifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of their ziff, and of their copper, and of their brass and their iron; and a fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth part of all their grain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And all this did he take to support himself, and his wives and his concubines; and also his priests, and their wives and their concubines; thus he had changed the affairs of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated by his father, and consecrated new ones in their stead, such as were lifted up in the pride of their hearts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, and in their whoredoms, by the taxes which king Noah had put upon his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to support iniquity.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were deceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and priests; for they did speak flattering things unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of wood, and of all manner of precious things, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented with gold and silver and with precious things.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of fine work within the walls of the temple, of fine wood, and of copper, and of brass.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the seats which were set apart for the high priests, which were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that they might rest their bodies and their arms upon while they should speak lying and vain words to his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that he built a tower near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of Shemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built in the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on the hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for the children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation of his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that he placed his heart upon his riches, and he spent his time in riotous living with his wives and his concubines; and so did also his priests spend their time with harlots.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that he planted vineyards round about in the land; and he built wine-presses, and made wine in abundance; and therefore he became a wine-bibber, and also his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites began to come in upon his people, upon small numbers, and to slay them in their fields, and while they were tending their flocks.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep them off; but he did not send a sufficient number, and the Lamanites came upon them and killed them, and drove many of their flocks out of the land; thus the Lamanites began to destroy them, and to exercise their hatred upon them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that king Noah sent his armies against them, and they were driven back, or they drove them back for a time; therefore, they returned rejoicing in their spoil.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, because of this great victory they were lifted up in the pride of their hearts; they did boast in their own strength, saying that their fifty could stand against thousands of the Lamanites; and thus they did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the blood of their brethren, and this because of the wickedness of their king and priests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord&#x2014;Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit them in mine anger.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it shall come to pass that they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it shall come to pass that except this people repent and turn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into bondage; and none shall deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto me I will be slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And except they repent in sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their God, I will not hear their prayers, neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his life; but the Lord delivered him out of their hands.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had spoken unto the people, he was also wroth; and he said: Who is Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is the Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him, for he has said these things that he might stir up my people to anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people; therefore I will slay him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore they hardened their hearts against the words of Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him.  And king Noah hardened his heart against the word of the Lord, and he did not repent of his evil doings.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye should understand that God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father, being the Father and the Son&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> The Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And thus the flesh becoming subject to the Spirit, or the Son to the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and scourged, and cast out, and disowned by his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And after all this, after working many mighty miracles among the children of men, he shall be led, yea, even as Isaiah said, as a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation?  Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed.  And now what say ye?  And who shall be his seed?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord&#x2014;I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions.  And now, are they not his seed?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean all the holy prophets ever since the world began?  I say unto you that they are his seed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And these are they who have published peace, who have brought good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, I say unto you, this is not all.  For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For were it not for the redemption which he hath made for his people, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, I say unto you, were it not for this, all mankind must have perished.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, the bands of death shall be broken, and the Son reigneth, and hath power over the dead; therefore, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection; yea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and who are, and who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ&#x2014;for so shall he be called.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands of death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And these are those who have part in the first resurrection; and these are they that have died before Christ came, in their ignorance, not having salvation declared unto them.  And thus the Lord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a part in the first resurrection, or have eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And little children also have eternal life.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> But behold, and fear, and tremble before God, for ye ought to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that rebel against him and die in their sins; yea, even all those that have perished in their sins ever since the world began, that have wilfully rebelled against God, that have known the commandments of God, and would not keep them; these are they that have no part in the first resurrection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore ought ye not to tremble?  For salvation cometh to none such; for the Lord hath redeemed none such; yea, neither can the Lord redeem such; for he cannot deny himself; for he cannot deny justice when it has its claim.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now I say unto you that the time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, Lord, thy watchmen shall lift up their voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_18.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And as many as would hear his word he did teach.  And he taught them privately, that it might not come to the knowledge of the king.  And many did believe his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that as many as did believe him did go forth to a place which was called Mormon, having received its name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma resorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither to hear his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma.  Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him.  And he did teach them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another&#x2019;s burdens, that they may be light;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into the water, and baptized him according to the first, only he did not bury himself again in the water.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time forward.  And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Alma, having authority from God, ordained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And thus he commanded them to preach.  And thus they became the children of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks to the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had ordained should labor with their own hands for their support.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together to teach the people, and to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to assemble themselves together.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of God, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the knowledge of God, that they might teach with power and authority from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And these things were done in the borders of the land, that they might not come to the knowledge of the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But behold, it came to pass that the king, having discovered a movement among the people, sent his servants to watch them.

            <li id="mosiah_18.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And now the king said that Alma was stirring up the people to rebellion against him; therefore he sent his army to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Alma and the people of the Lord were apprised of the coming of the king&#x2019;s army; therefore they took their tents and their families and departed into the wilderness.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now when the king had heard these words, he said unto his priests: Away with this fellow, and slay him; for what have we to do with him, for he is mad.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they stood forth and attempted to lay their hands on him; but he withstood them, and said unto them:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested that I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But I must fulfil the commandments wherewith God has commanded me; and because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me.  And again, because I have spoken the word of God ye have judged me that I am mad.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken these words that the people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on him, for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him; and his face shone with exceeding luster, even as Moses&#x2019; did while in the mount of Sinai, while speaking with the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he spake with power and authority from God; and he continued his words, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Ye see that ye have not power to slay me, therefore I finish my message. Yea, and I perceive that it cuts you to your hearts because I tell you the truth concerning your iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, and my words fill you with wonder and amazement, and with anger.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But I finish my message; and then it matters not whither I go, if it so be that I am saved.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But this much I tell you, what you do with me, after this, shall be as a type and a shadow of things which are to come.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now I read unto you the remainder of the commandments of God, for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts; I perceive that ye have studied and taught iniquity the most part of your lives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of things which are in heaven above, or which are in the earth beneath, or which are in the water under the earth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And again: Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord thy God, thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Thou shalt not kill.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Thou shalt not commit adultery.  Thou shalt not steal.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor&#x2019;s.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that after Abinadi had made an end of these sayings that he said unto them: Have ye taught this people that they should observe to do all these things for to keep these commandments?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord would not have caused me to come forth and to prophesy evil concerning this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of Moses.  I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there should be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very strict law; for they were a stiffnecked people, quick to do iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were types of things to come.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now, did they understand the law?  I say unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law; and this because of the hardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them concerning the coming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people?  Yea, and even all the prophets who have prophesied ever since the world began&#x2014;have they not spoken more or less concerning these things?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Have they not said that God himself should come down among the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Yea, and have they not said also that he should bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, should be oppressed and afflicted?</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his people if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it is the faith which we have had on the things which our king has spoken unto us that has brought us to this great knowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such exceedingly great joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not bring upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as has been spoken by the angel, that we may not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free.  There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be called by some other name; therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the name that I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him?  I say unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him out.  I say unto you, that even so shall it be among you if ye know not the name by which ye are called.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after the space of two years that Abinadi came among them in disguise, that they knew him not, and began to prophesy among them, saying: Thus has the Lord commanded me, saying&#x2014;Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for they have hardened their hearts against my words; they have repented not of their evil doings; therefore, I will visit them in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their iniquities and abominations.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, wo be unto this generation!  And the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to pass that this generation, because of their iniquities, shall be brought into bondage, and shall be smitten on the cheek; yea, and shall be driven by men, and shall be slain; and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall devour their flesh.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it shall come to pass that the life of king Noah shall be valued even as a garment in a hot furnace; for he shall know that I am the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it shall come to pass that I will smite this my people with sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with pestilence; and I will cause that they shall howl all the day long.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and I will cause that they shall have burdens lashed upon their backs; and they shall be driven before like a dumb ass.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it shall come to pass that I will send forth hail among them, and it shall smite them; and they shall also be smitten with the east wind; and insects shall pester their land also, and devour their grain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they shall be smitten with a great pestilence&#x2014;and all this will I do because of their iniquities and abominations.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that except they repent I will utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth; yet they shall leave a record behind them, and I will preserve them for other nations which shall possess the land; yea, even this will I do that I may discover the abominations of this people to other nations.  And many things did Abinadi prophesy against this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they were angry with him; and they took him and carried him bound before the king, and said unto the king: Behold, we have brought a man before thee who has prophesied evil concerning thy people, and saith that God will destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he also prophesieth evil concerning thy life, and saith that thy life shall be as a garment in a furnace of fire.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again, he saith that thou shalt be as a stalk, even as a dry stalk of the field, which is run over by the beasts and trodden under foot.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And again, he saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a thistle, which, when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is driven forth upon the face of the land.  And he pretendeth the Lord hath spoken it.  And he saith all this shall come upon thee except thou repent, and this because of thine iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done, or what great sins have thy people committed, that we should be condemned of God or judged of this man?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, O king, behold, we are guiltless, and thou, O king, hast not sinned; therefore, this man has lied concerning you, and he has prophesied in vain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And behold, we are strong, we shall not come into bondage, or be taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in the land, and thou shalt also prosper.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands; thou mayest do with him as seemeth thee good.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that king Noah caused that Abinadi should be cast into prison; and he commanded that the priests should gather themselves together that he might hold a council with them what he should do with him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they said unto the king: Bring him hither that we may question him; and the king commanded that he should be brought before them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And they began to question him, that they might cross him, that thereby they might have wherewith to accuse him; but he answered them boldly, and withstood all their questions, yea, to their astonishment; for he did withstand them in all their questions, and did confound them in all their words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught by our fathers, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth;</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of the land of our fathers&#x2019; first inheritance, and having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them&#x2014;but when I saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness, for I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he being an austere and a blood-thirsty man commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Nevertheless, after many days&#x2019; wandering in the wilderness we pitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain, which was near to the land of our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men into the city, in unto the king, that I might know of the disposition of the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my people and possess the land in peace.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I might possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the land, and I and my people went into the land that we might possess it.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of the city, yea, even the walls of the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with neas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and we did begin to multiply and prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to bring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we might possess it.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore it came to pass, that after we had dwelt in the land for the space of twelve years that king Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any means my people should wax strong in the land, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they were desirous to bring us into bondage, that they might glut themselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might feast themselves upon the flocks of our fields.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began to stir up his people that they should contend with my people; therefore there began to be wars and contentions in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of Shilom, when my people were watering and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not overtaken, even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for protection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and my people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle against the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to the Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them out of our land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their dead.  And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two hundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.</li>

In <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1?lang=eng">Mosiah&#xA0;1&#x2013;3</a>, you will read about a different kind of king. Rather than living off the labors of his people, King Benjamin &#x201C;labored with [his] own hands&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p14#p14">Mosiah 2:14</a>). Instead of having others serve him, he served his people &#x201C;with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord [had] granted unto [him]&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">Mosiah 2:11</a>). This king did not want his people to worship him; rather, he taught them to worship their Heavenly King, Jesus Christ. King Benjamin understood that it is &#x201C;the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Mosiah 3:5</a>), who came &#x201C;down from heaven&#x201D; and went &#x201C;forth amongst men, &#x2026; that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p5,9#p5">Mosiah 3:5,&#xA0;9</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154069188" id="p3">What do you think King Benjamin would say if you asked him why he served with all his &#x201C;might, mind and strength&#x201D;? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">Mosiah 2:11</a>). Ponder this as you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p10-p26#p10">Mosiah 2:10&#x2013;26</a>. What did King Benjamin teach that inspires you to serve others in a more meaningful way? For example, what does it mean to you to know that when you serve other people, you are also serving God? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17">Mosiah 2:17</a>). Seek inspiration about how you can serve someone this week.</p>
<p data-aid="154069194" id="p4">Even when we know we should serve others, we sometimes face challenges. Another way to study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p10-p26#p10">Mosiah 2:10&#x2013;26</a> is to make a list of truths King Benjamin taught that can help you overcome the challenges that might keep you from serving. What experiences have shown you that what King Benjamin taught is true?</p>
<p data-aid="154069200" id="p5">President Joy&#xA0;D. Jones shared a powerful experience that changed the way she looked at serving others. Read about it in &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2018/10/for-him?lang=eng">For Him</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2018, 50&#x2013;52), and think about the opportunities you have to serve others. You might even list a few and ponder how President Jones&#x2019;s message, along with <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17">Mosiah 2:17</a>, might influence the way you approach these opportunities. A hymn such as &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/a-poor-wayfaring-man-of-grief?lang=eng">A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;29) or a video like &#x201C;The Old Shoemaker&#x201D; (Gospel Library) might help you think of additional insights.</p>

You could read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p21#p21">Mosiah 2:21</a> and start a list of blessings Heavenly Father has given us.

<p data-aid="154069326" id="p19">Here&#x2019;s a game you could play to help your children recognize Heavenly Father&#x2019;s blessings. The children could pass around a picture of the Savior as they sing or listen to a song about gratitude (see &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/childrens-songbook/topics?lang=eng">Gratitude</a>&#x201D; in the topics index of the <cite>Children&#x2019;s Songbook</cite>). Stop singing or stop the music periodically, and invite whoever is holding the picture to talk about a blessing they are grateful for.

<p data-aid="154070659" id="p1">Large fires can start from a single spark. Abinadi was only one man testifying against a powerful king and his court. His words were rejected for the most part, and he was sentenced to death. Yet his testimony of Jesus Christ, who is the &#x201C;light &#x2026; that can never be darkened&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p9#p9">Mosiah 16:9</a>), sparked something inside the young priest Alma. And that spark of conversion slowly grew as Alma brought many others to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The flames that killed Abinadi eventually died out, but the fire of faith that his words created would have a lasting influence on the Nephites&#x2014;and on people who read his words today. Most of us will never face quite what Abinadi did because of our testimonies, but we all have moments when following Jesus Christ is a test of our courage and faith. Perhaps studying Abinadi&#x2019;s testimony will fan the flames of testimony and courage in your heart as well.</p>

<p data-aid="154070976" id="p23">Though it&#x2019;s a short chapter, <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/14?lang=eng">Mosiah&#xA0;14</a> has several words and phrases that describe Jesus Christ. Maybe you and your children could list them as you read the chapter together. Then you could talk about how you feel about the Savior as you study these words and phrases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070979" id="p24">To teach about Jesus Christ, Abinadi quoted the prophet Isaiah, who compared us to lost sheep. Perhaps your children could share experiences when they lost something or were lost themselves. How did they feel? What did they do? Then you could read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">Mosiah 14:6</a> and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p4-p9#p4">16:4&#x2013;9</a>. How are we like sheep who wander from God? How does Jesus Christ help us come back?</p>

<p data-aid="154069167" id="p1">Have you ever heard someone speak and felt inspired to change your life? Perhaps you decided, because of what you heard, to live a little differently&#x2014;or even a lot differently. King Benjamin&#x2019;s sermon was that kind of sermon, and the truths he taught had that kind of effect on the people who heard them. King Benjamin shared with his people what an angel had taught him&#x2014;that wonderful blessings were possible through &#x201C;the atoning blood of Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 4:2</a>). Because of His message, they changed their view of themselves (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 4:2</a>), the Spirit changed their desires (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 5:2</a>), and they covenanted with God that they would always do His will (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Mosiah 5:5</a>). This is how King Benjamin&#x2019;s words affected his people. How will they affect you?</p>

<p data-aid="154069190" id="p2">Sometimes, even when you have felt forgiven of your sins, you might struggle to keep that feeling and stay on the path of righteousness. King Benjamin taught his people how to both receive and retain a remission of sins. As you study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng">chapter&#xA0;4</a> of Mosiah, consider asking questions like these:</p>

<p data-aid="154069257" id="p11">King Benjamin&#x2019;s invitation to believe in and trust God is as important today as it was in ancient times. As you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p10#p5">Mosiah 4:5&#x2013;10</a>, look for truths about God that give you reason to trust Him. Note the invitations King Benjamin gives in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10">verse&#xA0;10</a>. Why would trusting God make it easier to do what King Benjamin invites?</p>

<p data-aid="154069411" id="p23">Serving others makes us feel good. Perhaps your children could talk about a time when they loved or served someone and how that experience made them feel. What are some reasons people might not want to serve others? What could we say to someone to invite them to help people in need? Look for ideas in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p16-p26#p16">Mosiah 4:16&#x2013;26</a>.</p>

<p data-aid="154069416" id="p24">King Benjamin taught that when we come unto Christ and receive a remission of our sins, we are &#x201C;filled with the love of God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12">Mosiah 4:12</a>). This leads us to be loving and kind toward others. You and your children could search <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p13-p16,26#p13">Mosiah 4:13&#x2013;16,&#xA0;26</a> (or a song like &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/childrens-songbook/ill-walk-with-you?lang=eng">I&#x2019;ll Walk with You</a>,&#x201D; <cite>Children&#x2019;s Songbook</cite>, 140&#x2013;41) and find phrases that describe how we can serve others. They could then act out these things or draw pictures of them and guess each other&#x2019;s phrases. How can we show love and kindness at home, at school, or at church?</p>

Generations had passed, and Mosiah&#x2019;s people had heard nothing from them. So, Mosiah asked Ammon to lead a search party to find the Nephites who had left. The search party found that these Nephites, &#x201C;because of iniquity&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p24#p24">Mosiah 7:24</a>), were in captivity to the Lamanites.

<p data-aid="154070635" id="p2">Sometimes we&#x2019;re like these captive Nephites, suffering because of our sins, wondering how we&#x2019;ll ever find peace again.

No matter our circumstances, we all need to repent and &#x201C;turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart,&#x201D; with faith that &#x201C;he will &#x2026; deliver [us]&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p33#p33">Mosiah 7:33</a>).</p>
