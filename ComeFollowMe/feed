        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold, there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he has done?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people and against our law?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And those judges were angry with him because he spake plainly unto them concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for they feared the people lest they should cry out against them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer this man to revile against us?  For behold he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are powerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no power over us.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to anger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities.  And behold they are many, and he knoweth as well all things which shall befall us as he knoweth of our iniquities;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified concerning those things.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying: Behold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swallowed them up?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great power given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God should come?  And as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up who should come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And as many as should look upon that serpent should live, even so as many as should look upon the Son of God with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with gladness and did rejoice.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were many before the days of Abraham who were called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days of Abraham there have been many prophets that have testified these things; yea, behold, the prophet Zenos did testify boldly; for the which he was slain.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet who testified of the destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed according to the words of Jeremiah.  O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy?</li>
            <li id="hel_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed?  Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek?  Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem?  But behold, this is not all&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he testified of these things.  Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because of that which is to come.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot deny them except ye shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many evidences which ye have received; yea, even ye have received all things, both things in heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as a witness that they are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because of your murders and your fornication and wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea, and except ye repent it will come unto you soon.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto the judgment-seat, and search; and behold, your judge is murdered, and he lieth in his blood; and he hath been murdered by his brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="hel_8.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And behold, they both belong to your secret band, whose author is Gadianton and the evil one who seeketh to destroy the souls of men.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One&#x2014;yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!</li>
            <li id="hel_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom&#x2019;s paths!</li>
            <li id="hel_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, behold at his voice do the hills and the mountains tremble and quake.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And by the power of his voice they are broken up, and become smooth, yea, even like unto a valley.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, by the power of his voice doth the whole earth shake;</li>
            <li id="hel_12.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, by the power of his voice, do the foundations rock, even to the very center.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, and if he say unto the earth&#x2014;Move&#x2014;it is moved.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, if he say unto the earth&#x2014;Thou shalt go back, that it lengthen out the day for many hours&#x2014;it is done;</li>
            <li id="hel_12.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And thus, according to his word the earth goeth back, and it appeareth unto man that the sun standeth still; yea, and behold, this is so; for surely it is the earth that moveth and not the sun.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, also, if he say unto the waters of the great deep&#x2014;Be thou dried up&#x2014;it is done.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Behold, if he say unto this mountain&#x2014;Be thou raised up, and come over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up&#x2014;behold it is done.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, if a man hide up a treasure in the earth, and the Lord shall say&#x2014;Let it be accursed, because of the iniquity of him who hath hid it up&#x2014;behold, it shall be accursed.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And if the Lord shall say&#x2014;Be thou accursed, that no man shall find thee from this time henceforth and forever&#x2014;behold, no man getteth it henceforth and forever.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, if the Lord shall say unto a man&#x2014;Because of thine iniquities, thou shalt be accursed forever&#x2014;it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And if the Lord shall say&#x2014;Because of thine iniquities thou shalt be cut off from my presence&#x2014;he will cause that it shall be so.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And wo unto him to whom he shall say this, for it shall be unto him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this cause, that men might be saved, hath repentance been declared.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Therefore, blessed are they who will repent and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And may God grant, in his great fulness, that men might be brought unto repentance and good works, that they might be restored unto grace for grace, according to their works.</li>
            <li id="hel_12.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And I would that all men might be saved.  But we read that in the great and last day there are some who shall be cast out, yea, who shall be cast off from the presence of the Lord;</li>
            <li id="hel_12.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Yea, who shall be consigned to a state of endless misery, fulfilling the words which say: They that have done good shall have everlasting life; and they that have done evil shall have everlasting damnation.  And thus it is.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass in the sixty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla from the land northward.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For he had been forth among the people who were in the land northward, and did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto them;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they did reject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among them, but returned again unto the land of his nativity.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the judgment-seats&#x2014;having usurped the power and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:</li>
            <li id="hel_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall be filled with sorrow because of this the wickedness of my brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by which led the highway.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower; and they ran and told the people what they had seen, and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people who had gathered together.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them: Behold, why have ye gathered yourselves together?  That I may tell you of your iniquities?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities!</li>
            <li id="hel_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon your hearts.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, how could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> O repent ye, repent ye!  Why will ye die?  Turn ye, turn ye unto the Lord your God.  Why has he forsaken you?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him to anger against you.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye will repent, behold, he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> O, how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he has delivered you?</li>
            <li id="hel_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver.  And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent.  For if ye will not repent, behold, this great city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words. Now therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that there arose a division among the people, insomuch that they divided hither and thither and went their ways, leaving Nephi alone, as he was standing in the midst of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own house, pondering upon the things which the Lord had shown unto him.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass as he was thus pondering&#x2014;being much cast down because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, their secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of iniquities&#x2014;and it came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came unto him saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people.  And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God.  Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple it shall be rent in twain, it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, it shall be done.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, if ye shall say that God shall smite this people, it shall come to pass.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now behold, I command you, that ye shall go and declare unto this people, that thus saith the Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except ye repent ye shall be smitten, even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these words unto Nephi, he did stop and did not go unto his own house, but did return unto the multitudes who were scattered about upon the face of the land, and began to declare unto them the word of the Lord which had been spoken unto him, concerning their destruction if they did not repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now behold, notwithstanding that great miracle which Nephi had done in telling them concerning the death of the chief judge, they did harden their hearts and did not hearken unto the words of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Nephi did declare unto them the word of the Lord, saying: Except ye repent, thus saith the Lord, ye shall be smitten even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that when Nephi had declared unto them the word, behold, they did still harden their hearts and would not hearken unto his words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to lay their hands upon him that they might cast him into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not take him to cast him into prison, for he was taken by the Spirit and conveyed away out of the midst of them.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit, from multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words; and there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided against themselves and began to slay one another with the sword.</li>
            <li id="hel_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these words, certain men who were among them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, even there were five who went, and they said among themselves, as they went:</li>
            <li id="hel_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Behold, now we will know of a surety whether this man be a prophet and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous things unto us.  Behold, we do not believe that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that he be dead, then will we believe that the other words which he has spoken are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto the judgment-seat; and behold, the chief judge had fallen to the earth, and did lie in his blood.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now behold, when they saw this they were astonished exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not believed the words which Nephi had spoken concerning the chief judge.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them lest all the judgments which Nephi had spoken should come upon the people; therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, immediately when the judge had been murdered&#x2014;he being stabbed by his brother by a garb of secrecy, and he fled, and the servants ran and told the people, raising the cry of murder among them;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold the people did gather themselves together unto the place of the judgment-seat&#x2014;and behold, to their astonishment they saw those five men who had fallen to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the multitude who had gathered together at the garden of Nephi; therefore they said among themselves: These men are they who have murdered the judge, and God has smitten them that they could not flee from us.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound them and cast them into prison.  And there was a proclamation sent abroad that the judge was slain, and that the murderers had been taken and were cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow the people did assemble themselves together to mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great chief judge who had been slain.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus also those judges who were at the garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying: Where are the five who were sent to inquire concerning the chief judge whether he was dead?  And they answered and said: Concerning this five whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but there are five who are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the judges desired that they should be brought; and they were brought, and behold they were the five who were sent; and behold the judges inquired of them to know concerning the matter, and they told them all that they had done, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> We ran and came to the place of the judgment-seat, and when we saw all things even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished insomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast us into prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now, as for the murder of this man, we know not who has done it; and only this much we know, we ran and came according as ye desired, and behold he was dead, according to the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold, we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the burial.  Nevertheless, they did rebuke the judges in the words which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways that they might cross him, that they might accuse him to death&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath done this murder?  Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault; saying, Behold here is money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement which thou hast made with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But Nephi said unto them: O ye fools, ye uncircumcised of heart, ye blind, and ye stiffnecked people, do ye know how long the Lord your God will suffer you that ye shall go on in this your way of sin?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> O ye ought to begin to howl and mourn, because of the great destruction which at this time doth await you, except ye shall repent.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Behold ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should murder Seezoram, our chief judge.  But behold, I say unto you, that this is because I have testified unto you that ye might know concerning this thing; yea, even for a witness unto you, that I did know of the wickedness and abominations which are among you.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And because I have done this, ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should do this thing; yea, because I showed unto you this sign ye are angry with me, and seek to destroy my life.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now behold, I will show unto you another sign, and see if ye will in this thing seek to destroy me.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold I say unto you: Go to the house of Seantum, who is the brother of Seezoram, and say unto him&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_9.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Has Nephi, the pretended prophet, who doth prophesy so much evil concerning this people, agreed with thee, in the which ye have murdered Seezoram, who is your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And behold, he shall say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And ye shall say unto him: Have ye murdered your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And he shall stand with fear, and wist not what to say.  And behold, he shall deny unto you; and he shall make as if he were astonished; nevertheless, he shall declare unto you that he is innocent.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But behold, ye shall examine him, and ye shall find blood upon the skirts of his cloak.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And when ye have seen this, ye shall say: From whence cometh this blood?  Do we not know that it is the blood of your brother?</li>
            <li id="hel_9.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And then shall he tremble, and shall look pale, even as if death had come upon him.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And then shall ye say: Because of this fear and this paleness which has come upon your face, behold, we know that thou art guilty.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And then shall greater fear come upon him; and then shall he confess unto you, and deny no more that he has done this murder.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And then shall he say unto you, that I, Nephi, know nothing concerning the matter save it were given unto me by the power of God.  And then shall ye know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent unto you from God.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as Nephi had said unto them.  And behold, the words which he had said were true; for according to the words he did deny; and also according to the words he did confess.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And he was brought to prove that he himself was the very murderer, insomuch that the five were set at liberty, and also was Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And there were some of the Nephites who believed on the words of Nephi; and there were some also, who believed because of the testimony of the five, for they had been converted while they were in prison.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And now there were some among the people, who said that Nephi was a prophet.</li>
            <li id="hel_9.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And there were others who said: Behold, he is a god, for except he was a god he could not know of all things.  For behold, he has told us the thoughts of our hearts, and also has told us things; and even he has brought unto our knowledge the true murderer of our chief judge.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="hel_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the reign of the judges that the contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land among all the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it was this secret band of robbers who did carry on this work of destruction and wickedness.  And this war did last all that year; and in the seventy and third year it did also last.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And so it was done, according to the words of Nephi.  And there was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi.  And thus in the seventy and fourth year the famine did continue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword but became sore by famine.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And this work of destruction did also continue in the seventy and fifth year.  For the earth was smitten that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their God; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the people began to plead with their chief judges and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that the judges did say unto Nephi, according to the words which had been desired.  And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that the people had repented and did humble themselves in sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them insomuch that they have become extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, O Lord, because of this their humility wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in the season of grain.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my words, for thou saidst that: If this people repent I will spare them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the famine and the pestilence and destruction which has come unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they will serve thee?  And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy words which thou hast said.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit.  And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did cover the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west to the sea east.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace.  And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by the prophets.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much strife.  But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain number who were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their brethren.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they became an exceedingly great band of robbers; and they did search out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into the wilderness and upon the mountains to search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> But behold, it came to pass that in that same year they were driven back even into their own lands.  And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first year they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and they were also visited with much destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness and out of the mountains unto their own lands, because of the exceeding greatness of the numbers of those robbers who infested the mountains and the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that thus ended this year.  And the robbers did still increase and wax strong, insomuch that they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come unto the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially their women and their children.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their iniquity, did stir them up again in remembrance of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And thus ended the eighty and first year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And in the eighty and second year they began again to forget the Lord their God.  And in the eighty and third year they began to wax strong in iniquity.  And in the eighty and fourth year they did not mend their ways.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year they did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness; and thus they were ripening again for destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_11.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And thus ended the eighty and fifth year.</li>

            <li id="hel_14.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And behold, he said unto them: Behold, I give unto you a sign; for five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all those who shall believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold this is not all, there shall be many signs and wonders in heaven.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it shall come to pass that ye shall all be amazed, and wonder, insomuch that ye shall fall to the earth.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the Son of God, the same shall have everlasting life.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the way of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent have I come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judgments of God which do await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;</li>

            <li id="hel_14.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of his death.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death&#x2014;that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord.</li>

            <li id="hel_14.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost there shall be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall shake and tremble; and the rocks which are upon the face of this earth, which are both above the earth and beneath, which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be found in seams and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth, yea, both above the earth and beneath.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places which are now called valleys which shall become mountains, whose height is great.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And behold, thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space of three days.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of this land, to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_14.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</li>
            <li id="hel_14.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</li>

            <li id="hel_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to mourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt to flee and there shall be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them which are with child, for they shall be heavy and cannot flee; therefore, they shall be trodden down and shall be left to perish.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, wo unto this people who are called the people of Nephi except they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them.</li>
            <li id="hel_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated because their deeds have been evil continually, and this because of the iniquity of the tradition of their fathers.

            <li id="hel_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it, that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="hel_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.</li>

And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working miracles among the people, that they might know that the Christ must shortly come&#x2014;</li>

            <li id="hel_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the people.</li>

            <li id="hel_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges, there were great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the scriptures began to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon their own strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot come to pass, of which has been spoken.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to reason and to contend among themselves, saying:</li>
            <li id="hel_16.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself unto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, why will he not show himself in this land as well as in the land of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="hel_16.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield ourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And many more things did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="hel_16.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman and his sons.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 1</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed away and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief judge and the governor over the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest son, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which had been kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man knoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead, yea, the record of this people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and greater miracles wrought among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath been vain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken might not come to pass.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord all that day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son&#x2014;of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh.  And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day.  And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the words of the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass also that a new star did appear, according to the word.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins.  And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses.  Now in this thing they did err, having not understood the scriptures.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were convinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known unto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass away till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year were they brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess their faults.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come to pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they began to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_1.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth year;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of Mosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was given, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come into the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of the records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be found in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had passed away the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction because of this war, which had become exceedingly sore.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites.  And thus ended the thirteenth year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret places.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And thus ended the fourteenth year.  And in the fifteenth year they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many contentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many advantages over them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people in a state of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of their iniquity.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their secret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both which were in the land south and which were in the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found that it was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was no way that they could subsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land insomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from before them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain.  And thus was the end of Giddianhi the robber.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did return again to their place of security.  And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in the twentieth year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store,</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the wilderness insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with hunger.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by night, and falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by tens of thousands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, because of the great destruction which came upon them by night and by day.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and march into the furthermost parts of the land northward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of their weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their retreat.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front and in their rear.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in their places of retreat.  And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up prisoners unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were slain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead.  And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing, and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God.  And they did cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_4.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word&#x2014;Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you with utter destruction.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us&#x2014;not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will command that my armies shall come down against you, and they shall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall become extinct.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been handed down unto us.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and government, who have dissented away from you because of your wickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs.  I am Giddianhi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in nowise be delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains over all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great commander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land Desolation.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land.  Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land northward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_3.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies.  And Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of every kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of all the holy prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that they must be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come, because of the many signs which had been given, according to the words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and night.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would murder no more were set at liberty.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have those secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against their brethren were condemned and punished according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret, and abominable combinations, in the which there was so much wickedness, and so many murders committed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the twenty and third year also, and the twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and thus had twenty and five years passed away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there had many things transpired which, in the eyes of some, would be great and marvelous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this book; yea, this book cannot contain even a hundredth part of what was done among so many people in the space of twenty and five years;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold there are records which do contain all the proceedings of this people; and a shorter but true account was given by Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore I have made my record of these things according to the record of Nephi, which was engraven on the plates which were called the plates of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, I do make the record on plates which I have made with mine own hands.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all return to their own lands in the twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and his cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their provisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and they did return to their own lands and their possessions, both on the north and on the south, both on the land northward and on the land southward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and those who had been appointed leaders, who had established this great peace in the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and there were many old cities repaired.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had continual peace.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began to be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride and boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers, and many officers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this&#x2014;Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do all manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a few years.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year&#x2014;the people having been delivered up for the space of a long time to be carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should&#x2014;and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel against God.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did govern the people that year.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent forth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry because of those who testified of these things; and those who were angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been high priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers were angry with those who testified of these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could have power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation was signed by the governor of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now there were many of those who testified of the things pertaining to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put to death secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their death came not unto the governor of the land until after their death.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that any man should be put to death except they had power from the governor of the land&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned the prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up before the judge, to be judged of the crime which they had done, according to the law which had been given by the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and the high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with the kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine against all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord, and enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those who were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be administered according to the law.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_6.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their country; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the governor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land should no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a king over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon the judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the people were divided one against another; and they did separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and thus they became tribes and leaders of tribes.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much family and many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes became exceedingly great.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they did yield themselves unto the power of Satan.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the regulations of the government were destroyed, because of the secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those who murdered the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch that the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become wicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had given his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes of the people, who were united together save it were their leaders did establish their laws, every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred of those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the government.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people.  And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they were divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders.  But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that Nephi&#x2014;having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds&#x2014;went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book.  And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Thus passed away the thirty and second year also.  And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with water.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a remission of their sins.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="3 ne_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did keep the record&#x2014;for he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed away;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the time that there should be darkness for the space of three days over the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among the people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it was about to divide asunder.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had been known in all the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were drowned.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in the place of the city there became a great mountain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And there was a great and terrible destruction in the land southward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the land northward; for behold, the whole face of the land was changed, because of the tempest and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings and the lightnings, and the exceedingly great quaking of the whole earth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled, and many smooth places became rough.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And many great and notable cities were sunk, and many were burned, and many were shaken till the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain, and the places were left desolate.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And there were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was exceedingly great, and there were many in them who were slain.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there were some who were carried away in the whirlwind; and whither they went no man knoweth, save they know that they were carried away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found in broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease&#x2014;for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours&#x2014;and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen could feel the vapor of darkness;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any light at all;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great city Moronihah.  And thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous among them, I did send down fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I sent among them might not cry unto me from the ground against them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And many great destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and upon this people, because of their wickedness and their abominations.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the land did hear these sayings, and did witness of it.  And after these sayings there was silence in the land for the space of many hours;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For so great was the astonishment of the people that they did cease lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain; therefore there was silence in all the land for the space of many hours.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings shall become desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the covenant to your fathers.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words, behold, they began to weep and howl again because of the loss of their kindred and friends.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away.  And it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled which had been spoken by the prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not carried away in the whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him search them, and see and behold if all these deaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by tempests, and by whirlwinds, and by the opening of the earth to receive them, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of these things at the coming of Christ, and were slain because they testified of these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these things, and also Zenock spake concerning these things, because they testified particularly concerning us, who are the remnant of their seed.</li>

And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph?  And these things which testify of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and fourth year, behold, I will show unto you that the people of Nephi who were spared, and also those who had been called Lamanites, who had been spared, did have great favors shown unto them, and great blessings poured out upon their heads, insomuch that soon after the ascension of Christ into heaven he did truly manifest himself unto them&#x2014;</li>

            <li id="3 ne_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with another, and were showing one to another the great and marvelous change which had taken place.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name&#x2014;hear ye him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Hosanna!  Blessed be the name of the Most High God!  And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord and did kiss his feet.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the Lord commanded him that he should arise.  And he arose and stood before him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize.  And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them&#x2014;Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying:</li>

            <li id="3 ne_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize.  And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_12.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And behold, I have given you the law and the commandments of my Father, that ye shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent of your sins, and come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit.

            <li id="3 ne_12.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost senine.  And while ye are in prison can ye pay even one senine?  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;</li>

            <li id="3 ne_12.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And again it is written, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;</li>

            <li id="3 ne_12.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever cometh of more than these is evil.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And behold, it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> But I say unto you, that ye shall not resist evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;</li>

            <li id="3 ne_12.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn thou not away.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> But behold I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_12.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.</li>

            <li id="3 ne_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Verily, verily, I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet before you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men.  Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the hypocrites, for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.  Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.  Amen.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For, if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Moreover, when ye fast be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast.  Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father, who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> The light of the body is the eye; if, therefore, thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.  If, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.  Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he looked upon the twelve whom he had chosen, and said unto them: Remember the words which I have spoken.  For behold, ye are they whom I have chosen to minister unto this people.  Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.  Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.  Are ye not much better than they?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And why take ye thought for raiment?  Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, even so will he clothe you, if ye are not of little faith.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?  or, What shall we drink?  or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</li>
            <li id="3 ne_13.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof.</li>

            <li id="hel_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that in this year there was one Samuel, a Lamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people.  And it came to pass that he did preach, many days, repentance unto the people, and they did cast him out, and he was about to return to his own land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, that he should return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things should come into his heart.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should enter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the wall thereof, and stretched forth his hand and cried with a loud voice, and prophesied unto the people whatsoever things the Lord put into his heart.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, heavy destruction awaiteth this people, and it surely cometh unto this people, and nothing can save this people save it be repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, who surely shall come into the world, and shall suffer many things and shall be slain for his people.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, an angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he did bring glad tidings to my soul.  And behold, I was sent unto you to declare it unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but behold ye would not receive me.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will withdraw my Spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And four hundred years shall not pass away before I will cause that they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword and with famine and with pestilence.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of the fourth generation who shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter destruction; and this shall surely come except ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth generation shall visit your destruction.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord your God I will turn away mine anger, saith the Lord; yea, thus saith the Lord, blessed are they who will repent and turn unto me, but wo unto him that repenteth not.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for behold, it is because of those who are righteous that it is saved; yea, wo unto this great city, for I perceive, saith the Lord, that there are many, yea, even the more part of this great city, that will harden their hearts against me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> But blessed are they who will repent, for them will I spare.  But behold, if it were not for the righteous who are in this great city, behold, I would cause that fire should come down out of heaven and destroy it.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, it is for the righteous&#x2019; sake that it is spared.  But behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall cast out the righteous from among you, then shall ye be ripe for destruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of the wickedness and abominations which are in her.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the wickedness and abominations which are in her.</li>

            <li id="hel_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And behold, a curse shall come upon the land, saith the Lord of Hosts, because of the people&#x2019;s sake who are upon the land, yea, because of their wickedness and their abominations.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the earth shall find them again no more, because of the great curse of the land, save he be a righteous man and shall hide it up unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their treasures unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up their treasures unto me; for none hideth up their treasures unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasures unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because they have set their hearts upon riches; and because they have set their hearts upon their riches, and will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before their enemies; because they will not hide them up unto me, cursed be they and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my words; yea, hearken unto the words which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye are cursed because of your riches, and also are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon them, and have not hearkened unto the words of him who gave them unto you.</li>
            <li id="hel_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities.</li>

<p data-aid="154410312" id="p1">Nephi&#x2019;s father, Helaman, had urged his sons to &#x201C;remember, remember.&#x201D; He wanted them to remember their ancestors, remember the words of the prophets, and most of all, remember &#x201C;our Redeemer, who is Christ&#x201D; (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p14#p5">Helaman 5:5&#x2013;14</a>). It&#x2019;s clear that Nephi did remember because this is the same message he declared years later &#x201C;with unwearyingness&#x201D; to the people (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p4#p4">Helaman 10:4</a>). &#x201C;How could you have forgotten your God?&#x201D; he asked (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p20#p20">Helaman 7:20</a>). All of Nephi&#x2019;s efforts&#x2014;preaching, praying, performing miracles, and petitioning God for a famine&#x2014;were attempts to help the people turn to God and remember Him. In many ways, forgetting God is an even bigger problem than not knowing Him. And it&#x2019;s easy to forget Him when our minds are distracted by &#x201C;the vain things of this world&#x201D; and clouded by sin (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p21#p21">Helaman 7:21</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Helaman 12:2</a>). But, as Nephi&#x2019;s ministry shows, it&#x2019;s never too late to remember and &#x201C;turn &#x2026; unto the Lord your God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17">Helaman 7:17</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154410521" id="p20">To start a conversation about remembering the Lord, you could tell your children about a time when you forgot something. Let them share similar experiences of their own. Then you could read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p20-p21#p20">Helaman 7:20&#x2013;21</a> and ask your children what they think it means to forget God. Maybe your children could draw pictures of things that could cause us to forget the Lord and use their drawings to cover a picture of Jesus. Then they could think of things they can do to remember Him. As they share their thoughts, they could take away the drawings one by one until the picture of the Savior is revealed.</p>

Samuel understood the importance of the message he bore and demonstrated faith by following God&#x2019;s commandment &#x201C;that he should return again, and prophesy&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">Helaman 13:3</a>). Like Samuel, we all encounter walls as we &#x201C;prepare the way of the Lord&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p9#p9">Helaman 14:9</a>) and strive to follow His prophets. And like Samuel, we too bear witness of Jesus Christ, &#x201C;who surely shall come,&#x201D; and invite all to &#x201C;believe on his name&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">Helaman 13:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">14:13</a>). Not everyone will listen, and some may actively oppose us. But those who believe in this message with faith in Christ find that it truly is a message of &#x201C;glad tidings of great joy&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p14#p14">Helaman 16:14</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154410330" id="p2">In the scriptures, prophets are sometimes compared to watchmen on a wall or tower who warn of danger (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/isa/62?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">Isaiah 62:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p7#p1">Ezekiel 33:1&#x2013;7</a>). As you study Samuel&#x2019;s words in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng">Helaman&#xA0;13</a>, consider how he is like a watchman for you. What did he say that seems relevant to our day? (see especially <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p8,21-p22,26-p29,31,38#p8">verses 8, 21&#x2013;22, 26&#x2013;29,&#xA0;31, and&#xA0;38</a>). For example, what did Samuel teach about repentance? about humility and wealth? about seeking happiness &#x201C;in doing iniquity&#x201D;?</p>
<p data-aid="154410332" id="p3">You might also search recent conference messages for similar warnings the Lord has given through modern prophets. What do you feel inspired to do about these warnings?</p>
<figure class="for-teacher" data-purpose="teaching-improvement" id="figure2">
<p data-aid="154410335" id="figure2_p1"><strong>Look for patterns.</strong> A pattern is a plan or model that can be used as a guide for accomplishing a task. In the scriptures, we find patterns that show how the Lord accomplishes His work, such as sending His servants to warn the people.</p>

<p data-aid="154410348" id="p4">Samuel&#x2019;s warnings of the judgments of God consistently included a merciful invitation to repent. Look for these invitations throughout <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng">Helaman 13&#x2013;15</a> (see especially <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p11#p6">Helaman 13:6&#x2013;11</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p19#p15">14:15&#x2013;19</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p7-p8#p7">15:7&#x2013;8</a>). What do you learn from these verses about repentance? Some people see repentance as a harsh punishment&#x2014;something to avoid. In your opinion, how did Samuel want the Nephites to see repentance?</p>
<p data-aid="154410352" id="p5">To deepen your study, you could read President Russell&#xA0;M. Nelson&#x2019;s message &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson?lang=eng">We Can Do Better and Be Better</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, May 2019, 67). How does he define repentance? What blessings of sincere repentance do you find in his message? You might also look for specific things the prophet invited us to change. What is the Holy Ghost telling you that you need to change? Consider writing down the personal revelation you receive.</p>
<p data-aid="154410356" id="p6">How is repentance different than just changing your behavior? Why is it important to accept God&#x2019;s invitation to repent? As you ponder this, consider singing or listening to a hymn that expresses this invitation, such as &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/how-gentle-gods-commands?lang=eng">How Gentle God&#x2019;s Commands</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;125).</p>

<p data-aid="154410416" id="p12">Samuel&#x2019;s words contain many stern chastisements, but <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">Helaman 15:3</a> gives us perspective on chastening from the Lord. How can chastisement from the Lord be a sign of His love? What evidence do you see of the Lord&#x2019;s love and mercy in Samuel&#x2019;s prophecies and warnings?</p>

<p data-aid="154410477" id="p15">How can you teach your children that God can speak to our heart, as He did for Samuel? Perhaps you could ask them to show you different ways to communicate without words (such as gestures or facial expressions). This could lead to a discussion about different ways that Heavenly Father communicates with us. As part of this discussion, you and your children could look at a picture of Samuel the Lamanite (this outline has two) and read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p2-p5#p2">Helaman 13:2&#x2013;5</a> as your children listen for how God told Samuel what to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154410484" id="p16">Many of us&#x2014;especially children&#x2014;need help learning to recognize <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> God is speaking to us. You might tell your children about a time when the Holy Ghost helped you know in your heart what God wanted you to do or say. Explain how you knew that God was communicating with you. Perhaps your children could also share any similar experiences they have had.</p>

With these words, the resurrected Savior introduced Himself, fulfilling over 600&#xA0;years of Book of Mormon prophecies. &#x201C;That appearance and that declaration,&#x201D; Elder Jeffrey&#xA0;R. Holland wrote, &#x201C;constituted the focal point, the supreme moment, in the entire history of the Book of Mormon. It was the manifestation and the decree that had informed and inspired every Nephite prophet. &#x2026; Everyone had talked of him, sung of him, dreamed of him, and prayed for his appearance&#x2014;but here he actually was. The day of days! The God who turns every dark night into morning light had arrived&#x201D; (<cite>Christ and the New Covenant</cite> [1997], 250&#x2013;51).</p>

Perhaps, after reading these, you could write some guidelines for recognizing revelation: <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p12#p11">1&#xA0;Kings 19:11&#x2013;12</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/gal/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p22-p23#p22">Galatians 5:22&#x2013;23</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&amp;id=p27-p28,35#p27">Alma 32:27&#x2013;28, 35</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p2-p4#p2">Helaman 10:2&#x2013;4</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p12#p11">Ether 4:11&#x2013;12</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9?lang=eng&amp;id=p7-p9#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 9:7&#x2013;9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p14#p11">11:11&#x2013;14</a>.</p>
<p data-aid="154410537" id="p15">You could also benefit from hearing from today&#x2019;s prophets, apostles, and other Church leaders who have experience hearing and following God&#x2019;s voice.

<p data-aid="154410725" id="p22">Perhaps you could read some of these verses in a soft, &#x201C;small voice&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">3&#xA0;Nephi 11:3</a>). Or you could play a recording of a song like &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/childrens-songbook/this-is-my-beloved-son?lang=eng">This Is My Beloved Son</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Children&#x2019;s Songbook</cite>, 76) softly so that it is difficult to hear. What did the people have to do to understand the voice from heaven? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p7#p5">verses 5&#x2013;7</a>).

<p data-aid="154411363" id="p1">In some ways, it was an exciting time to be a believer in Jesus Christ. Prophecies were being fulfilled&#x2014;great signs and miracles among the people indicated that the Savior would soon be born. On the other hand, it was also an anxious time for believers because, in spite of all the miracles, unbelievers insisted that &#x201C;the time was past&#x201D; for the Savior to be born (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:5</a>). These people caused &#x201C;a great uproar throughout the land&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:7</a>) and even set a date to kill all the believers if the sign prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite&#x2014;a night without darkness&#x2014;did not appear.</p>
<p data-aid="154411366" id="p2">In these difficult circumstances, the prophet Nephi &#x201C;cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:11</a>). The Lord&#x2019;s response is inspiring to anyone who faces persecution or doubt and needs to know that light will overcome darkness: &#x201C;Lift up your head and be of good cheer; &#x2026; I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:13</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154411438" id="p15">Your Heavenly Father knows that your life will include moments that are difficult, even frightening. But He also wants you to experience joy. Read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p23#p1">3&#xA0;Nephi 1:1&#x2013;23</a> to learn about the reasons the faithful Nephites had to be afraid. What reason did the Lord give them to &#x201C;be of good cheer&#x201D;?</p>
<p data-aid="154411441" id="p16">The Savior has used the phrase &#x201C;be of good cheer&#x201D; on several occasions&#x2014;for example, in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p24-p27#p24">Matthew 14:24&#x2013;27</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p33#p33">John 16:33</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61?lang=eng&amp;id=p36#p36">Doctrine and Covenants 61:36</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78?lang=eng&amp;id=p17-p19#p17">78:17&#x2013;19</a>. What impresses you about these invitations? You might read surrounding verses to understand the circumstances in which the Savior said these words. In each case, what reasons did He give to help people face their fears? How has he done this for you?</p>
<p data-aid="154411443" id="p17">Consider studying President Russell&#xA0;M. Nelson&#x2019;s address &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2016/10/joy-and-spiritual-survival?lang=eng">Joy and Spiritual Survival</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2016, 81&#x2013;84). What does President Nelson teach you about finding joy in any situation? Notice how many times President Nelson uses the word focus. Maybe you could compare focusing a camera or other lens to focusing on Jesus Christ. How will you focus on Him more?</p>
