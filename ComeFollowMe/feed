        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_25.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more angry because they had slain their brethren; therefore they swore vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But they took their armies and went over into the borders of the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people who were in the land of Ammonihah and destroyed them.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And after that, they had many battles with the Nephites, in the which they were driven and slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And among the Lamanites who were slain were almost all the seed of Amulon and his brethren, who were the priests of Noah, and they were slain by the hands of the Nephites;</li>
            <li id="alma_25.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and having usurped the power and authority over the Lamanites, caused that many of the Lamanites should perish by fire because of their belief&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_25.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For many of them, after having suffered much loss and so many afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the words which Aaron and his brethren had preached to them in their land; therefore they began to disbelieve the traditions of their fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great power unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of the children of Amulon caused that they should be put to death, yea, all those that believed in these things.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should be stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the wilderness; and the Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon and his brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into the east wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites.  Thus the words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said concerning the seed of the priests who caused that he should suffer death by fire.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me shall be a type of things to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now Abinadi was the first that suffered death by fire because of his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that many should suffer death by fire, according as he had suffered.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should cause many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and that they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep having no shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts; and now behold, these words were verified, for they were driven by the Lamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they did also bury their weapons of war, according as their brethren had, and they began to be a righteous people; and they did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep his commandments and his statutes.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient that they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled.  But notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look forward to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of Moses was a type of his coming, and believing that they must keep those outward performances until the time that he should be revealed unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now they did not suppose that salvation came by the law of Moses; but the law of Moses did serve to strengthen their faith in Christ; and thus they did retain a hope through faith, unto eternal salvation, relying upon the spirit of prophecy, which spake of those things to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_25.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and their brethren did rejoice exceedingly, for the success which they had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had granted unto them according to their prayers, and that he had also verified his word unto them in every particular.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_28.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were established in the land of Jershon, and a church also established in the land of Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set round about the land of Jershon, yea, in all the borders round about the land of Zarahemla; behold the armies of the Lamanites had followed their brethren into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as never had been known among all the people in the land from the time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the Lamanites were slain and scattered abroad.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter among the people of Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites were driven and scattered, and the people of Nephi returned again to their land.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now this was a time that there was a great mourning and lamentation heard throughout all the land, among all the people of Nephi&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_28.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, the cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also of fathers mourning for their sons, and the daughter for the brother, yea, the brother for the father; and thus the cry of mourning was heard among all of them, mourning for their kindred who had been slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of solemnity, and a time of much fasting and prayer.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi;</li>
            <li id="alma_28.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their journeyings in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land, their sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehensible joy, and the reception and safety of the brethren in the land of Jershon.  And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless their souls forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites; and the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is ended.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And from the first year to the fifteenth has brought to pass the destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has brought to pass an awful scene of bloodshed.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the bodies of many thousands are laid low in the earth, while the bodies of many thousands are moldering in heaps upon the face of the earth; yea, and many thousands are mourning for the loss of their kindred, because they have reason to fear, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are consigned to a state of endless wo.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> While many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of their kindred, yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and even know, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are raised to dwell at the right hand of God, in a state of never-ending happiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of sin and transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by the cunning plans which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_28.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And thus we see the great call of diligence of men to labor in the vineyards of the Lord; and thus we see the great reason of sorrow, and also of rejoicing&#x2014;sorrow because of death and destruction among men, and joy because of the light of Christ unto life.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_34.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_34.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that these things were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you what ye should do, because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_34.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are true.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true.  Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another.  Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother?  I say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</li>
            <li id="alma_34.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need&#x2014;I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God.  Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ;</li>
            <li id="alma_34.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptations of the devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing.</li>
            <li id="alma_34.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile against those who do cast you out because of your exceeding poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them;</li>
            <li id="alma_34.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> But that ye have patience, and bear with those afflictions, with a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions.</li>

            <li id="alma_32.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the people, entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their streets.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to have success among the poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_32.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the world.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them, and that they were in a preparation to hear the word.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched forth his hand, and cried unto those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent, and said unto them:</li>
            <li id="alma_32.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do?&#x2014;for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we cannot worship our God.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed&#x2014;yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now I ask, is this faith?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now of this thing ye must judge.  Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now as I said concerning faith&#x2014;faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also.  Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out&#x2014;now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_32.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now, as I said concerning faith&#x2014;that it was not a perfect knowledge&#x2014;even so it is with my words.  Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Now, we will compare the word unto a seed.  Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves&#x2014;It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now behold, would not this increase your faith?  I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow.  And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith?  Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed?  I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect?  Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> O then, is not this real?  I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?</li>
            <li id="alma_32.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us.  And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.</li>
            <li id="alma_32.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_26.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which say thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we started from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted unto us such great blessings?</li>
            <li id="alma_26.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can ye tell?</li>
            <li id="alma_26.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God!  And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and have been brought into the fold of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves!  And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, who have so dearly beloved us, would still have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they would also have been strangers to God.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love, and this because of the power of his word which is in us, therefore have we not great reason to rejoice?</li>
            <li id="alma_26.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most High God, and has loosed our brethren from the chains of hell.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and destruction; but behold, he has brought them into his everlasting light, yea, into everlasting salvation; and they are encircled about with the matchless bounty of his love; yea, and we have been instruments in his hands of doing this great and marvelous work.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea, we will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God forever.  Behold, who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much of his great power, and of his mercy, and of his long-suffering towards the children of men?  Behold, I say unto you, I cannot say the smallest part which I feel.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state?</li>
            <li id="alma_26.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings to destroy his church.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction, yea, why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us, and doom us to eternal despair?</li>
            <li id="alma_26.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought.  Behold, he did not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over that everlasting gulf of death and misery, even to the salvation of our souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now behold, my brethren, what natural man is there that knoweth these things?  I say unto you, there is none that knoweth these things, save it be the penitent.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing&#x2014;unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn?</li>
            <li id="alma_26.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth?  Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning?  Now my brethren, ye remember that this was their language.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that we destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and destroy us.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness not with the intent to destroy our brethren, but with the intent that perhaps we might save some few of their souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the world&#x2014;not upon the mercies of the world alone but upon the mercies of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we have taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and their synagogues and taught them; and we have been cast out, and mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have been stoned, and taken and bound with strong cords, and cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been delivered again.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this, that perhaps we might be the means of saving some soul; and we supposed that our joy would be full if perhaps we could be the means of saving some.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our labors; and are they few?  I say unto you, Nay, they are many; yea, and we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren and also towards us.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and they have buried their weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards their brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in all the land?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to be slain.  But behold how many of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because of their love and of their hatred to sin.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Now have we not reason to rejoice?  Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo.  Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land.</li>
            <li id="alma_26.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth.  Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="alma_29.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</li>

            <li id="alma_29.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> I ought not to harrow up in my desires the firm decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called?</li>
            <li id="alma_29.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_29.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it.  I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and by this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers; and that same God who delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians did deliver them out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea, and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word unto this people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth much fruit; and how great shall be their reward!</li>
            <li id="alma_29.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were, so great is my joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_29.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit of their labors that they may go no more out, but that they may praise him forever.  And may God grant that it may be done according to my words, even as I have spoken.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_27.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites who had gone to war against the Nephites had found, after their many struggles to destroy them, that it was in vain to seek their destruction, they returned again to the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their loss, were exceedingly angry.  And when they saw that they could not seek revenge from the Nephites, they began to stir up the people in anger against their brethren, the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now this people again refused to take their arms, and they suffered themselves to be slain according to the desires of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction among those whom they so dearly beloved, and among those who had so dearly beloved them&#x2014;for they were treated as though they were angels sent from God to save them from everlasting destruction&#x2014;therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw this great work of destruction, they were moved with compassion, and they said unto the king:</li>
            <li id="alma_27.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Let us gather together this people of the Lord, and let us go down to the land of Zarahemla to our brethren the Nephites, and flee out of the hands of our enemies, that we be not destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But the king said unto them: Behold, the Nephites will destroy us, because of the many murders and sins we have committed against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he say unto us, go down unto our brethren, will ye go?</li>
            <li id="alma_27.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go, we will go down unto our brethren, and we will be their slaves until we repair unto them the many murders and sins which we have committed against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law of our brethren, which was established by my father, that there should be any slaves among them; therefore let us go down and rely upon the mercies of our brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But the king said unto him: Inquire of the Lord, and if he saith unto us go, we will go; otherwise we will perish in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that Ammon went and inquired of the Lord, and the Lord said unto him:</li>
            <li id="alma_27.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Get this people out of this land, that they perish not; for Satan has great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir up the Lamanites to anger against their brethren to slay them; therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this people in this generation, for I will preserve them.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now it came to pass that Ammon went and told the king all the words which the Lord had said unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they gathered together all their people, yea, all the people of the Lord, and did gather together all their flocks and herds, and departed out of the land, and came into the wilderness which divided the land of Nephi from the land of Zarahemla, and came over near the borders of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and my brethren will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye shall remain here until we return; and we will try the hearts of our brethren, whether they will that ye shall come into their land.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the land, that he and his brethren met Alma, over in the place of which has been spoken; and behold, this was a joyful meeting.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now the joy of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea, he was swallowed up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting of his strength; and he fell again to the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now was not this exceeding joy?  Behold, this is joy which none receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of happiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was truly great, and also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold their joy was not that to exceed their strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back to the land of Zarahemla; even to his own house.  And they went and told the chief judge all the things that had happened unto them in the land of Nephi, among their brethren, the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the chief judge sent a proclamation throughout all the land, desiring the voice of the people concerning the admitting their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: Behold, we will give up the land of Jershon, which is on the east by the sea, which joins the land Bountiful, which is on the south of the land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the land which we will give unto our brethren for an inheritance.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon and the land Nephi, that we may protect our brethren in the land Jershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against their brethren lest they should commit sin; and this their great fear came because of their sore repentance which they had, on account of their many murders and their awful wickedness.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now behold, this will we do unto our brethren, that they may inherit the land Jershon; and we will guard them from their enemies with our armies, on condition that they will give us a portion of their substance to assist us that we may maintain our armies.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he returned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and made known unto them all these things.  And Alma also related unto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them.  And they went down into the land of Jershon, and took possession of the land of Jershon; and they were called by the Nephites the people of Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by that name ever after.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God.  And they were also distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren with the greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed upon to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did look upon death with any degree of terror, for their hope and views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore, death was swallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore, they would suffer death in the most aggravating and distressing manner which could be inflicted by their brethren, before they would take the sword or cimeter to smite them.</li>
            <li id="alma_27.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And thus they were a zealous and beloved people, a highly favored people of the Lord.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_30.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were established in the land of Jershon, yea, and also after the Lamanites were driven out of the land, and their dead were buried by the people of the land&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_30.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now their dead were not numbered because of the greatness of their numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites numbered&#x2014;but it came to pass after they had buried their dead, and also after the days of fasting, and mourning, and prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) there began to be continual peace throughout all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Yea, and the people did observe to keep the commandments of the Lord; and they were strict in observing the ordinances of God, according to the law of Moses; for they were taught to keep the law of Moses until it should be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus the people did have no disturbance in all the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year, there came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was Anti-Christ, for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies which had been spoken by the prophets, concerning the coming of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now there was no law against a man&#x2019;s belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will serve.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But if he murdered he was punished unto death; and if he robbed he was also punished; and if he stole he was also punished; and if he committed adultery he was also punished; yea, for all this wickedness they were punished.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For there was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes.  Nevertheless, there was no law against a man&#x2019;s belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could have no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that there should be no Christ.  And after this manner did he preach, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_30.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things?  Why do ye look for a Christ?  For no man can know of anything which is to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish traditions of your fathers.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> How do ye know of their surety?  Behold, ye cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins.  But behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms&#x2014;telling them that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach these things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and carried him before Ammon, who was a high priest over that people.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried out of the land.  And he came over into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much success, for he was taken and bound and carried before the high priest, and also the chief judge over the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye go about perverting the ways of the Lord?  Why do ye teach this people that there shall be no Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings?  Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the holy prophets?</li>
            <li id="alma_30.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now the high priest&#x2019;s name was Giddonah.  And Korihor said unto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Ye say that this people is a free people.  Behold, I say they are in bondage.  Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.  Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a Christ.  And ye say also that he shall be slain for the sins of the world&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_30.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God&#x2014;a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have labored even from the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto my people.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law for our time.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?</li>
            <li id="alma_30.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in their hearts?</li>
            <li id="alma_30.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And Korihor answered him, Yea.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?</li>
            <li id="alma_30.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And he answered, Nay.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God, and also deny the Christ?  For behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not?  I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto you that they are true; and will ye deny them?  Believest thou that these things are true?</li>
            <li id="alma_30.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God?  Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets?  The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is no God?  And yet will ye deny against all these witnesses?  And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show me a sign.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God?  In whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign?  Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee a sign?  Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?</li>
            <li id="alma_30.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that there was a God.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God.  And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say.  And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon me.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God, that the curse might be taken from him.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.55" class=""><span class="verse">55</span> But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.56" class=""><span class="verse">56</span> And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.57" class=""><span class="verse">57</span> Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same judgments would come unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.58" class=""><span class="verse">58</span> And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor.  And Korihor did go about from house to house, begging food for his support.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.59" class=""><span class="verse">59</span> And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram&#x2014;and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_30.60" class=""><span class="verse">60</span> And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_36.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I would not that ye think that I know of myself&#x2014;not of the temporal but of the spiritual, not of the carnal mind but of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things; but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, made these things known unto me, not of any worthiness of myself;</li>
            <li id="alma_36.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise.  And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words&#x2014;If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God&#x2014;I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</li>
            <li id="alma_36.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains.  Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors;</li>
            <li id="alma_36.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem; and he has also, by his everlasting power, delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from time to time even down to the present day; and I have always retained in remembrance their captivity; yea, and ye also ought to retain in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity.</li>
            <li id="alma_36.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.  Now this is according to his word.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_39.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my son, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I said unto thy brother; for behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments of God?  Behold, has he not set a good example for thee?</li>
            <li id="alma_39.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the Zoramites.  Now this is what I have against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And this is not all, my son.  Thou didst do that which was grievous unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron among the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot Isabel.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son.  Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?</li>
            <li id="alma_39.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is unpardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so great a crime.  I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for your good.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.  Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots.  Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy children to do good, lest they lead away the hearts of many people to destruction; therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of God, that ye refrain from your iniquities;</li>
            <li id="alma_39.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the coming of Christ.  Behold, I say unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings unto this people, to prepare their minds; or rather that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the minds of their children to hear the word at the time of his coming.</li>
            <li id="alma_39.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. Behold, you marvel why these things should be known so long beforehand.  Behold, I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as a soul will be at the time of his coming?</li>
            <li id="alma_39.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be made known unto this people as well as unto their children?</li>
            <li id="alma_39.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel to declare these glad tidings unto us as unto our children, or as after the time of his coming?</li>

            <li id="alma_37.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer?</li>
            <li id="alma_37.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God.  And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land&#x2014;but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them) behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto you, for he has fulfilled his promises which he has made unto our fathers.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For he promised unto them that he would preserve these things for a wise purpose in him, that he might show forth his power unto future generations.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the restoration of many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also still show forth his power in them unto future generations; therefore they shall be preserved.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in fulfilling all my words, and that ye be diligent in keeping the commandments of God as they are written.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four plates, that ye keep them, that the mysteries and the works of darkness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those people who have been destroyed, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their plunderings, and all their wickedness and abominations, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these interpreters.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders and abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed from off the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the word of God might be fulfilled, which he spake, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_37.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret works and their abominations; and except they repent I will destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their secrets and abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they have been destroyed, and thus far the word of God has been fulfilled; yea, their secret abominations have been brought out of darkness and made known unto us.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all their signs and their wonders ye shall keep from this people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction shall come upon all those workers of darkness, according to the power of God, when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people might not be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and their covenants from this people, and only their wickedness and their murders and their abominations shall ye make known unto them; and ye shall teach them to abhor such wickedness and abominations and murders; and ye shall also teach them that these people were destroyed on account of their wickedness and abominations and their murders.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came among them to declare unto them concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their God for vengeance upon those who were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of darkness and secret combinations.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those workers of darkness and secret combinations, even unto destruction, except they repent before they are fully ripe.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto you; trust not those secret plans unto this people, but teach them an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, or director&#x2014;or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious a workmanship.  And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And it did work for them according to their faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was done; therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means it did show unto them marvelous works.  They were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey;</li>
            <li id="alma_37.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass (now these things were temporal) they did not prosper; even so it is with things which are spiritual.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And now I say, is there not a type in this thing?  For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us.  The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_37.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things, yea, see that ye look to God and live.  Go unto this people and declare the word, and be sober.  My son, farewell.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_41.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this thing.  And I perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning this thing.  But behold, I will explain it unto thee.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order.  Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part of the body should be restored to itself.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil.  Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame&#x2014;mortality raised to immortality, corruption to incorruption&#x2014;raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_41.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And so it is on the other hand.  If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness.  Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?</li>
            <li id="alma_41.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish&#x2014;good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.</li>
            <li id="alma_41.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 42</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_42.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand&#x2014;which is concerning the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee.  For behold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken&#x2014;yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_42.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_42.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, it was appointed unto man to die&#x2014;therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth&#x2014;and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;</li>
            <li id="alma_42.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice.  Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the life of the soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now, how could a man repent except he should sin?  How could he sin if there was no law?  How could there be a law save there was a punishment?</li>
            <li id="alma_42.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of conscience unto man.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now, if there was no law given&#x2014;if a man murdered he should die&#x2014;would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?</li>
            <li id="alma_42.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could justice do, or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon the creature?</li>
            <li id="alma_42.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice?  I say unto you, Nay; not one whit.  If so, God would cease to be God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world.  And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more.  Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility.</li>
            <li id="alma_42.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people.  And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them.  And may God grant unto you even according to my words.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="alma_38.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word&#x2019;s sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare unto me that I must stop the work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins.  But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ.  Behold, he is the life and the light of the world.  Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy&#x2014;yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.</li>
            <li id="alma_38.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down in peace.  Now go, my son, and teach the word unto this people.  Be sober.  My son, farewell.</li>

            <li id="alma_35.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of these words, they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over into the land of Jershon.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the word unto the Zoramites, also came over into the land of Jershon.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the Zoramites had consulted together concerning the words which had been preached unto them, they were angry because of the word, for it did destroy their craft; therefore they would not hearken unto the words.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they sent and gathered together throughout all the land all the people, and consulted with them concerning the words which had been spoken.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now their rulers and their priests and their teachers did not let the people know concerning their desires; therefore they found out privily the minds of all the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all the people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were many; and they came over also into the land of Jershon.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did minister unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of Ammon who were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the Zoramites, being a very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon desiring them that they should cast out of their land all those who came over from them into their land.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he breathed out many threatenings against them.  And now the people of Ammon did not fear their words; therefore they did not cast them out, but they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites that came over unto them; and they did nourish them, and did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for their inheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their wants.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger against the people of Ammon, and they began to mix with the Lamanites and to stir them up also to anger against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against the people of Ammon, and also against the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon, and came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon for the armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and the Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges; and an account shall be given of their wars hereafter.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the two sons of Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, after having been instruments in the hands of God of bringing many of the Zoramites to repentance; and as many as were brought to repentance were driven out of their land; but they have lands for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have taken up arms to defend themselves, and their wives, and children, and their lands.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now Alma, being grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea for the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which were among them; and having been to declare the word, or sent to declare the word, among all the people in every city; and seeing that the hearts of the people began to wax hard, and that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.</li>
            <li id="alma_35.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together, that he might give unto them every one his charge, separately, concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness. And we have an account of his commandments, which he gave unto them according to his own record.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_40.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say unto thee; for I perceive that thy mind is worried concerning the resurrection of the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection&#x2014;or, I would say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on immortality, this corruption does not put on incorruption&#x2014;until after the coming of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead.  But behold, my son, the resurrection is not yet.  Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are kept, that no one knoweth them save God himself.  But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I might know&#x2014;that is concerning the resurrection.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth from the dead.  Now when this time cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time which is appointed.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case&#x2014;that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the time of the resurrection.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from this time of death to the time appointed for the resurrection?</li>
            <li id="alma_40.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise it mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this mattereth not; all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the resurrection.  And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I do know.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know that God knoweth all the times which are appointed unto man.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection&#x2014;Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil&#x2014;for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house&#x2014;and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection.  Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first resurrection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their consignation to happiness or misery.  Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the soul with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into heaven.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_40.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_40.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter cup.</li>

            <li id="alma_33.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that they might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or how they should plant the seed, or the word of which he had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues.  But behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has said concerning prayer or worship?</li>
            <li id="alma_33.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my prayer.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee, thou didst hear me.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto thee, to be heard of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear them.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out and have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger with speedy destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.</li>

            <li id="alma_33.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos said; for, behold he said: Thou hast turned away thy judgments because of thy Son.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the scriptures?  If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?</li>
            <li id="alma_33.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of these things, but Zenock also spake of these things&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_33.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord, with this people, because they will not understand thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them because of thy Son.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, my brethren, ye see that a second prophet of old has testified of the Son of God, and because the people would not understand his words they stoned him to death.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who have spoken concerning the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live.  And many did look and live.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts.  But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished.  Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?</li>
            <li id="alma_33.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.</li>
            <li id="alma_33.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall plant this word in your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your faith.  And behold, it will become a tree, springing up in you unto everlasting life.  And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son.  And even all this can ye do if ye will.  Amen.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 31</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_31.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to bow down to dumb idols, his heart again began to sicken because of the iniquity of the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to know of iniquity among his people; therefore his heart was exceedingly sorrowful because of the separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called Antionum, which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of Jershon, which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great loss on the part of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just&#x2014;yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them&#x2014;therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he took with him, and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took two of his sons.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were Shiblon and Corianton; and these are the names of those who went with him among the Zoramites, to preach unto them the word.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites; therefore they had had the word of God preached unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But they had fallen into great errors, for they would not observe to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land to preach the word unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the week, which day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did worship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had never beheld;</li>
            <li id="alma_31.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a place for standing, which was high above the head; and the top thereof would only admit one person.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and stand upon the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_31.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe that thou art holy, and that thou wast a spirit, and that thou art a spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou hast elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we thank thee; and we also thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish traditions of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, which doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee, our God.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy people.  Amen.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren and his sons had heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all measure.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> For behold, every man did go forth and offer up these same prayers.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which, being interpreted, is the holy stand.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were chosen of him, and that he did not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren, and that their hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this manner, they returned to their homes, never speaking of their God again until they had assembled themselves together again to the holy stand, to offer up thanks after their manner.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that they were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were lifted up unto great boasting, in their pride.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and cried, saying: O, how long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants shall dwell here below in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the children of men?</li>
            <li id="alma_31.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride.  Behold, O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of the world.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say&#x2014;We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that there shall be no Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and infidelity shall be among this people?  O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities.  For I am infirm, and such wickedness among this people doth pain my soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul in Christ.  O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may have strength, that I may suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success, and also my fellow laborers who are with me&#x2014;yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and also Amulek and Zeezrom and also my two sons&#x2014;yea, even all these wilt thou comfort, O Lord.  Yea, wilt thou comfort their souls in Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have strength, that they may bear their afflictions which shall come upon them because of the iniquities of this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words, that he clapped his hands upon all them who were with him.  And behold, as he clapped his hands upon them, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And after that they did separate themselves one from another, taking no thought for themselves what they should eat, or what they should drink, or what they should put on.</li>
            <li id="alma_31.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength, that they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ.  Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith.</li>

He felt something similar after returning from his mission to the Zoramites&#x2014;he observed that the hearts of many of the Nephites &#x201C;began to wax hard, and that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word,&#x201D; and this made his heart &#x201C;exceedingly sorrowful&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/35?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15">Alma 35:15</a>). What did Alma do about what he saw and felt? He didn&#x2019;t simply become discouraged or cynical about the state of the world. Instead, &#x201C;he caused that his sons should be gathered together&#x201D; and taught them &#x201C;things pertaining unto righteousness&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/35?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16">Alma 35:16</a>).

<p data-aid="154411258" id="p2">Few of us will have experiences as dramatic as Alma&#x2019;s conversion. But everyone must be &#x201C;born of God,&#x201D; though it usually happens gradually (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&amp;id=p23#p23">Alma 36:23</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">38:6</a>). As you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng">Alma&#xA0;36</a>, think about what it means to be born of God. For instance, in the process of being born of God, how do you feel about sin? about Jesus Christ? How does being born of God affect what you do in response to your own mistakes? What other changes occur in your beliefs and actions? Ponder how you are experiencing these changes.</p>

<p data-aid="154411340" id="p16">To help your children understand that repentance brings joy, you could give them a piece of paper with a happy face on one side and a sad face on the other. Ask them to listen while you read or summarize <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&amp;id=p13,17-p20#p13">Alma 36:13, 17&#x2013;20</a> and hold up one of the faces to show how Alma was feeling. Older children could write down words or phrases describing how he felt. What made Alma sad, and what brought him joy? Then you could tell them about the joy you feel when you repent.</p>

When the sons of Mosiah decided to preach the gospel to them, the Nephites &#x201C;laughed [them] to scorn.&#x201D; Killing the Lamanites seemed like a more plausible solution than converting them.

<p data-aid="154411257" id="p21">Perhaps your children would enjoy burying their &#x201C;weapons&#x201D; like the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. You could read a few verses from <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p24#p6">Alma 24:6&#x2013;24</a> to teach the children about the promises the Anti-Nephi-Lehies made to follow the Savior. They could then think of something they will change to follow Him, write it on this week&#x2019;s activity page, and pretend to dig a hole and bury their weapon.</p>

<p data-aid="154411260" id="p22">Your children could read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p19#p15">Alma 24:15&#x2013;19</a>, looking for what the Anti-Nephi-Lehies did &#x201C;as a testimony to God.&#x201D; Then you could talk with them about how our covenants can be &#x201C;a testimony to God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&amp;id=p18#p18">verse&#xA0;18</a>).

<div class="body-block">
<p data-aid="154411198" id="p1">The accounts in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng">Alma 30&#x2013;31</a> clearly demonstrate the power of words&#x2014;for evil and for good. The &#x201C;flattering&#x201D; and &#x201C;great swelling words&#x201D; of a false teacher named Korihor threatened to bring &#x201C;many souls down to destruction&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p31,47#p31">Alma 30:31,&#xA0;47</a>). Similarly, the teachings of a Nephite dissenter named Zoram led a whole group of people to fall &#x201C;into great errors&#x201D; and &#x201C;pervert the ways of the Lord&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p9,11#p9">Alma 31:9,&#xA0;11</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154411200" id="p2">In contrast, Alma had unwavering faith that the word of God would have a &#x201C;more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Alma 31:5</a>). Alma&#x2019;s words expressed eternal truth and drew upon the powers of Jesus Christ to silence Korihor (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p39-p50#p39">Alma 30:39&#x2013;50</a>), and they invited His blessing on those who went with him to bring the Zoramites back to the truth (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p31-p38#p31">Alma 31:31&#x2013;38</a>). These are valuable examples for followers of Christ today when false messages are common. We can find truth by trusting, as Alma did, &#x201C;the virtue of the word of God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Alma 31:5</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154411207" id="p3">In <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng">Alma&#xA0;30</a>, Korihor is called &#x201C;Anti-Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">verse&#xA0;6</a>). An anti-Christ is anyone or anything that is openly or secretly in opposition to Jesus Christ and His gospel. Which verses in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p31#p6">Alma 30:6&#x2013;31</a> show that Korihor fits this description? Studying Korihor&#x2019;s false teachings can help you recognize and reject similar teachings. The following activities may help in your study:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154411209" id="p4">What object lessons can you think of to better understand the difference between the Savior&#x2019;s teachings and Satan&#x2019;s false imitations? Some examples are a lure used for fishing, fake money, and false advertising. How can you tell if something is fake? How can you recognize truth?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154411211" id="p5">Consider making a list of the false doctrines Korihor taught in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p31#p6">Alma 30:6&#x2013;31</a>. Which of his teachings might be enticing today? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p12-p18,23-p28#p12">Alma 30:12&#x2013;18, 23&#x2013;28</a>). What harm can result from accepting such ideas? What false messages is the adversary using to try to deceive you today?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154411213" id="p6">What did Alma do to counter Korihor&#x2019;s teachings with truth? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p31-p54#p31">Alma 30:31&#x2013;54</a>). How can you use these same principles in your life?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154411215" id="p7">Like Alma, modern prophets and apostles help us know the difference between truth and Satan&#x2019;s lies. What counsel do you find in these messages: Gary&#xA0;E.

<p data-aid="154411314" id="p22">Briefly summarize the story of Alma and the Zoramites, using verses from <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p8-p35#p8">Alma 31:8&#x2013;35</a> (see also &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/book-of-mormon-stories-2024/32-the-zoramites?lang=eng">Chapter&#xA0;28: The Zoramites and the Rameumptom</a>,&#x201D; <cite>Book of Mormon Stories</cite>, 78&#x2013;80). Help your children identify things the Zoramites said in their prayer (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p18#p15">Alma 31:15&#x2013;18</a>) as they help you build a Rameumptom tower with blocks or rocks. Explain that this is not how we should pray. As you and your children talk about how we should pray, let them remove the blocks or rocks one at a time. Maybe they could keep one of the rocks by their bed as a reminder to pray every morning and night. They might enjoy decorating their rock.</p>

<p data-aid="154410243" id="p1">For the Zoramites, prayer consisted of standing where all could see and repeating empty, self-satisfied words. The Zoramites lacked faith in Jesus Christ&#x2014;even denied His existence&#x2014;and persecuted the poor (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p9-p25#p9">Alma 31:9&#x2013;25</a>). By contrast, Alma and Amulek taught that prayer has more to do with what happens in our hearts than on a public platform. And if we do not show compassion toward people in need, our prayer is &#x201C;vain, and availeth &#x2026; nothing&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p28#p28">Alma 34:28</a>). Most important, we pray because we have faith in Jesus Christ, who offers redemption through His &#x201C;infinite and eternal sacrifice&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10">Alma 34:10</a>). Such faith, Alma explained, starts with humility and a &#x201C;desire to believe&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&amp;id=p27#p27">Alma 32:27</a>). Over time, with constant nourishment, the word of God takes root in our hearts until it becomes &#x201C;a tree springing up unto everlasting life&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&amp;id=p41#p41">Alma 32:41</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154410264" id="p9">Notice how many times Amulek used the words <i>infinite</i> and <i>eternal</i> to describe the Savior&#x2019;s atoning sacrifice in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p9-p14#p9">Alma 34:9&#x2013;14</a>. Why is it important to know that the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement is infinite and eternal? Look for words and phrases in these verses that also describe the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement: <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/heb/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10">Hebrews 10:10</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&amp;id=p21#p21">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:21</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13">Mosiah 3:13</a>.</p>
<p data-aid="154410266" id="p10">Even when we know Jesus&#x2019;s power to save is infinite and eternal, we might sometimes doubt that it applies to us&#x2014;or to someone who has sinned against us. Elder David&#xA0;A. Bednar once spoke of people who &#x201C;seem to have faith in the Savior, but they do not believe His promised blessings are available to them&#x201D; (&#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2016/10/if-ye-had-known-me?lang=eng">If Ye Had Known Me</a>,&#x201D; <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, Nov. 2016,&#xA0;104). What might keep us from fully receiving the Savior&#x2019;s power? Ponder how you can know that the Atonement of Jesus Christ is infinite and eternal.</p>
<p data-aid="154410267" id="p11">To ponder how much you need the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement, it might help to think of something you need every day. Ask yourself, &#x201C;What would my life be like without this?&#x201D; Then, as you study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p9-p16#p9">Alma 34:9&#x2013;16</a>, ponder what your life would be like without Jesus Christ.
