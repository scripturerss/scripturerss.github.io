            <li id="mosiah_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having finished speaking to the people, that he should take the names of all those who had entered into a covenant with God to keep his commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it were little children, but who had entered into the covenant and had taken upon them the name of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had consecrated his son Mosiah to be a ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the charges concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to teach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God, and to stir them up in remembrance of the oath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they returned, every one, according to their families, to their own houses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And Mosiah began to reign in his father&#x2019;s stead.  And he began to reign in the thirtieth year of his age, making in the whole, about four hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And king Mosiah did cause his people that they should till the earth.  And he also, himself, did till the earth, that thereby he might not become burdensome to his people, that he might do according to that which his father had done in all things.  And there was no contention among all his people for the space of three years.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude, and rehearse unto them all that had happened unto their brethren from the time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time that he himself came up out of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king Benjamin had taught them, and explained them to the people of king Limhi, so that they might understand all the words which he spake.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return every one unto his own house.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the record of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could interpret languages, and Ammon told him that he could not.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are large, and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly sound.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again, they have brought swords, the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates.  Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate?  For I am desirous that these records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God.  And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!</li>
            <li id="mosiah_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the forest.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of the land of our fathers&#x2019; first inheritance, and having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them&#x2014;but when I saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness, for I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he being an austere and a blood-thirsty man commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Nevertheless, after many days&#x2019; wandering in the wilderness we pitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain, which was near to the land of our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men into the city, in unto the king, that I might know of the disposition of the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my people and possess the land in peace.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I might possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the land, and I and my people went into the land that we might possess it.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of the city, yea, even the walls of the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with neas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and we did begin to multiply and prosper in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to bring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we might possess it.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore it came to pass, that after we had dwelt in the land for the space of twelve years that king Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any means my people should wax strong in the land, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they were desirous to bring us into bondage, that they might glut themselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might feast themselves upon the flocks of our fields.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began to stir up his people that they should contend with my people; therefore there began to be wars and contentions in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of Shilom, when my people were watering and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not overtaken, even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for protection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and my people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle against the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to the Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them out of our land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their dead.  And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two hundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart.  And he had many wives and concubines.  And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord.  Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a fifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of their ziff, and of their copper, and of their brass and their iron; and a fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth part of all their grain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And all this did he take to support himself, and his wives and his concubines; and also his priests, and their wives and their concubines; thus he had changed the affairs of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated by his father, and consecrated new ones in their stead, such as were lifted up in the pride of their hearts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, and in their whoredoms, by the taxes which king Noah had put upon his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to support iniquity.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were deceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and priests; for they did speak flattering things unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of wood, and of all manner of precious things, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented with gold and silver and with precious things.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of fine work within the walls of the temple, of fine wood, and of copper, and of brass.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the seats which were set apart for the high priests, which were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that they might rest their bodies and their arms upon while they should speak lying and vain words to his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that he built a tower near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of Shemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built in the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on the hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for the children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation of his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that he placed his heart upon his riches, and he spent his time in riotous living with his wives and his concubines; and so did also his priests spend their time with harlots.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that he planted vineyards round about in the land; and he built wine-presses, and made wine in abundance; and therefore he became a wine-bibber, and also his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites began to come in upon his people, upon small numbers, and to slay them in their fields, and while they were tending their flocks.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep them off; but he did not send a sufficient number, and the Lamanites came upon them and killed them, and drove many of their flocks out of the land; thus the Lamanites began to destroy them, and to exercise their hatred upon them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that king Noah sent his armies against them, and they were driven back, or they drove them back for a time; therefore, they returned rejoicing in their spoil.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, because of this great victory they were lifted up in the pride of their hearts; they did boast in their own strength, saying that their fifty could stand against thousands of the Lamanites; and thus they did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the blood of their brethren, and this because of the wickedness of their king and priests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord&#x2014;Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit them in mine anger.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it shall come to pass that they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it shall come to pass that except this people repent and turn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into bondage; and none shall deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto me I will be slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And except they repent in sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their God, I will not hear their prayers, neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his life; but the Lord delivered him out of their hands.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had spoken unto the people, he was also wroth; and he said: Who is Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is the Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him, for he has said these things that he might stir up my people to anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people; therefore I will slay him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore they hardened their hearts against the words of Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him.  And king Noah hardened his heart against the word of the Lord, and he did not repent of his evil doings.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after the space of two years that Abinadi came among them in disguise, that they knew him not, and began to prophesy among them, saying: Thus has the Lord commanded me, saying&#x2014;Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for they have hardened their hearts against my words; they have repented not of their evil doings; therefore, I will visit them in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their iniquities and abominations.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, wo be unto this generation!  And the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to pass that this generation, because of their iniquities, shall be brought into bondage, and shall be smitten on the cheek; yea, and shall be driven by men, and shall be slain; and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall devour their flesh.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it shall come to pass that the life of king Noah shall be valued even as a garment in a hot furnace; for he shall know that I am the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it shall come to pass that I will smite this my people with sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with pestilence; and I will cause that they shall howl all the day long.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and I will cause that they shall have burdens lashed upon their backs; and they shall be driven before like a dumb ass.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it shall come to pass that I will send forth hail among them, and it shall smite them; and they shall also be smitten with the east wind; and insects shall pester their land also, and devour their grain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they shall be smitten with a great pestilence&#x2014;and all this will I do because of their iniquities and abominations.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that except they repent I will utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth; yet they shall leave a record behind them, and I will preserve them for other nations which shall possess the land; yea, even this will I do that I may discover the abominations of this people to other nations.  And many things did Abinadi prophesy against this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they were angry with him; and they took him and carried him bound before the king, and said unto the king: Behold, we have brought a man before thee who has prophesied evil concerning thy people, and saith that God will destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he also prophesieth evil concerning thy life, and saith that thy life shall be as a garment in a furnace of fire.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again, he saith that thou shalt be as a stalk, even as a dry stalk of the field, which is run over by the beasts and trodden under foot.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And again, he saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a thistle, which, when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is driven forth upon the face of the land.  And he pretendeth the Lord hath spoken it.  And he saith all this shall come upon thee except thou repent, and this because of thine iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done, or what great sins have thy people committed, that we should be condemned of God or judged of this man?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, O king, behold, we are guiltless, and thou, O king, hast not sinned; therefore, this man has lied concerning you, and he has prophesied in vain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And behold, we are strong, we shall not come into bondage, or be taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in the land, and thou shalt also prosper.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands; thou mayest do with him as seemeth thee good.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that king Noah caused that Abinadi should be cast into prison; and he commanded that the priests should gather themselves together that he might hold a council with them what he should do with him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that they said unto the king: Bring him hither that we may question him; and the king commanded that he should be brought before them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And they began to question him, that they might cross him, that thereby they might have wherewith to accuse him; but he answered them boldly, and withstood all their questions, yea, to their astonishment; for he did withstand them in all their questions, and did confound them in all their words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught by our fathers, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Break forth into joy; sing together ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now Abinadi said unto them: Are you priests, and pretend to teach this people, and to understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desire to know of me what these things mean?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> I say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the Lord!  For if ye understand these things ye have not taught them; therefore, ye have perverted the ways of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore, ye have not been wise.  Therefore, what teach ye this people?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And they said: We teach the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And again he said unto them: If ye teach the law of Moses why do ye not keep it?  Why do ye set your hearts upon riches?  Why do ye commit whoredoms and spend your strength with harlots, yea, and cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord has cause to send me to prophesy against this people, yea, even a great evil against this people?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Know ye not that I speak the truth?  Yea, ye know that I speak the truth; and you ought to tremble before God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it shall come to pass that ye shall be smitten for your iniquities, for ye have said that ye teach the law of Moses.  And what know ye concerning the law of Moses?  Doth salvation come by the law of Moses?  What say ye?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And they answered and said that salvation did come by the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But now Abinadi said unto them: I know if ye keep the commandments of God ye shall be saved; yea, if ye keep the commandments which the Lord delivered unto Moses in the mount of Sinai, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> I am the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Thou shalt have no other God before me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing in heaven above, or things which are in the earth beneath.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_12.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> Now Abinadi said unto them, Have ye done all this?  I say unto you, Nay, ye have not.  And have ye taught this people that they should do all these things?  I say unto you, Nay, ye have not.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace.  And I caused that there should be weapons of war made of every kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our fathers for many years, yea, for the space of twenty and two years.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all manner of grain and all manner of fruit of every kind.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and cloth of every kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land&#x2014;thus we did have continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son began to reign in his stead.  And he began to stir his people up in rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to come up to battle against my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But I had sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon, that I might discover their preparations, that I might guard against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men armed with bows, and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle about their loins.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children of my people should be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place them in their ranks, every man according to his age.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that we did go up in the strength of the Lord to battle.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength.  Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this&#x2014;Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord&#x2014;therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And his brethren were wroth with him because they understood not the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And again, they were wroth with him when they had arrived in the promised land, because they said that he had taken the ruling of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into the wilderness as the Lord had commanded him, and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he robbed them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And thus they have taught their children that they should hate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy them; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our land; and we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not number them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that we returned again to our own land, and my people again began to tend their flocks, and to till their ground.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_10.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I, being old, did confer the kingdom upon one of my sons; therefore, I say no more.  And may the Lord bless my people.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye should understand that God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father, being the Father and the Son&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> The Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And thus the flesh becoming subject to the Spirit, or the Son to the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and scourged, and cast out, and disowned by his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And after all this, after working many mighty miracles among the children of men, he shall be led, yea, even as Isaiah said, as a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation?  Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed.  And now what say ye?  And who shall be his seed?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord&#x2014;I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions.  And now, are they not his seed?</li>

For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For were it not for the redemption which he hath made for his people, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, I say unto you, were it not for this, all mankind must have perished.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But behold, the bands of death shall be broken, and the Son reigneth, and hath power over the dead; therefore, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection; yea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and who are, and who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ&#x2014;for so shall he be called.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands of death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And these are those who have part in the first resurrection; and these are they that have died before Christ came, in their ignorance, not having salvation declared unto them.  And thus the Lord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a part in the first resurrection, or have eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And little children also have eternal life.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> But behold, and fear, and tremble before God, for ye ought to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that rebel against him and die in their sins; yea, even all those that have perished in their sins ever since the world began, that have wilfully rebelled against God, that have known the commandments of God, and would not keep them; these are they that have no part in the first resurrection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore ought ye not to tremble?  For salvation cometh to none such; for the Lord hath redeemed none such; yea, neither can the Lord redeem such; for he cannot deny himself; for he cannot deny justice when it has its claim.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now I say unto you that the time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yea, Lord, thy watchmen shall lift up their voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_15.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_16.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come when all shall see the salvation of the Lord; when every nation, kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall confess before God that his judgments are just.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And then shall the wicked be cast out, and they shall have cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and this because they would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first parents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause of all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing evil from good, subjecting themselves to the devil.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over him.  Therefore he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though they had already come, there could have been no redemption.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no sting, there could have been no resurrection.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would not; they being warned of their iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to repent and yet they would not repent.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses, also teach that it is a shadow of those things which are to come&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_16.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_17.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that when Abinadi had finished these sayings, that the king commanded that the priests should take him and cause that he should be put to death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But there was one among them whose name was Alma, he also being a descendant of Nephi.  And he was a young man, and he believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity which Abinadi had testified against them; therefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But the king was more wroth, and caused that Alma should be cast out from among them, and sent his servants after him that they might slay him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But he fled from before them and hid himself that they found him not.  And he being concealed for many days did write all the words which Abinadi had spoken.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards should surround Abinadi and take him; and they bound him and cast him into prison.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And after three days, having counseled with his priests, he caused that he should again be brought before him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I will not recall the words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are true; and that ye may know of their surety I have suffered myself that I have fallen into your hands.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you.  And if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his word; for he feared that the judgments of God would come upon him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But the priests lifted up their voices against him, and began to accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king.  Therefore the king was stirred up in anger against him, and he delivered him up that he might be slain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto them, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of death by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his people.  O God, receive my soul.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_17.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_18.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And as many as would hear his word he did teach.  And he taught them privately, that it might not come to the knowledge of the king.  And many did believe his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that as many as did believe him did go forth to a place which was called Mormon, having received its name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma resorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither to hear his words.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma.  Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him.  And he did teach them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another&#x2019;s burdens, that they may be light;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into the water, and baptized him according to the first, only he did not bury himself again in the water.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time forward.  And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Alma, having authority from God, ordained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And thus he commanded them to preach.  And thus they became the children of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks to the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had ordained should labor with their own hands for their support.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together to teach the people, and to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to assemble themselves together.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of God, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the knowledge of God, that they might teach with power and authority from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And these things were done in the borders of the land, that they might not come to the knowledge of the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But behold, it came to pass that the king, having discovered a movement among the people, sent his servants to watch them. Therefore on the day that they were assembling themselves together to hear the word of the Lord they were discovered unto the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And now the king said that Alma was stirring up the people to rebellion against him; therefore he sent his army to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Alma and the people of the Lord were apprised of the coming of the king&#x2019;s army; therefore they took their tents and their families and departed into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_18.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And they were in number about four hundred and fifty souls.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_19.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that the army of the king returned, having searched in vain for the people of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And now behold, the forces of the king were small, having been reduced, and there began to be a division among the remainder of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the lesser part began to breathe out threatenings against the king, and there began to be a great contention among them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now there was a man among them whose name was Gideon, and he being a strong man and an enemy to the king, therefore he drew his sword, and swore in his wrath that he would slay the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that he fought with the king; and when the king saw that he was about to overpower him, he fled and ran and got upon the tower which was near the temple.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And Gideon pursued after him and was about to get upon the tower to slay the king, and the king cast his eyes round about towards the land of Shemlon, and behold, the army of the Lamanites were within the borders of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now the king cried out in the anguish of his soul, saying: Gideon, spare me, for the Lamanites are upon us, and they will destroy us; yea, they will destroy my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now the king was not so much concerned about his people as he was about his own life; nevertheless, Gideon did spare his life.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the king commanded the people that they should flee before the Lamanites, and he himself did go before them, and they did flee into the wilderness, with their women and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue them, and did overtake them, and began to slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now it came to pass that the king commanded them that all the men should leave their wives and their children, and flee before the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now there were many that would not leave them, but had rather stay and perish with them.  And the rest left their wives and their children and fled.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that those who tarried with their wives and their children caused that their fair daughters should stand forth and plead with the Lamanites that they would not slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites had compassion on them, for they were charmed with the beauty of their women.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Therefore the Lamanites did spare their lives, and took them captives and carried them back to the land of Nephi, and granted unto them that they might possess the land, under the conditions that they would deliver up king Noah into the hands of the Lamanites, and deliver up their property, even one half of all they possessed, one half of their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and thus they should pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites from year to year.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now there was one of the sons of the king among those that were taken captive, whose name was Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now Limhi was desirous that his father should not be destroyed; nevertheless, Limhi was not ignorant of the iniquities of his father, he himself being a just man.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Gideon sent men into the wilderness secretly, to search for the king and those that were with him. And it came to pass that they met the people in the wilderness, all save the king and his priests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now they had sworn in their hearts that they would return to the land of Nephi, and if their wives and their children were slain, and also those that had tarried with them, that they would seek revenge, and also perish with them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the king commanded them that they should not return; and they were angry with the king, and caused that he should suffer, even unto death by fire.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they were about to take the priests also and put them to death, and they fled before them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that they were about to return to the land of Nephi, and they met the men of Gideon.  And the men of Gideon told them of all that had happened to their wives and their children; and that the Lamanites had granted unto them that they might possess the land by paying a tribute to the Lamanites of one half of all they possessed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the people told the men of Gideon that they had slain the king, and his priests had fled from them farther into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that after they had ended the ceremony, that they returned to the land of Nephi, rejoicing, because their wives and their children were not slain; and they told Gideon what they had done to the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites made an oath unto them, that his people should not slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And also Limhi, being the son of the king, having the kingdom conferred upon him by the people, made oath unto the king of the Lamanites that his people should pay tribute unto him, even one half of all they possessed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that Limhi began to establish the kingdom and to establish peace among his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And the king of the Lamanites set guards round about the land, that he might keep the people of Limhi in the land, that they might not depart into the wilderness; and he did support his guards out of the tribute which he did receive from the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_19.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now king Limhi did have continual peace in his kingdom for the space of two years, that the Lamanites did not molest them nor seek to destroy them.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_20.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now there was a place in Shemlon where the daughters of the Lamanites did gather themselves together to sing, and to dance, and to make themselves merry.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that there was one day a small number of them gathered together to sing and to dance.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now the priests of king Noah, being ashamed to return to the city of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that the people would slay them, therefore they durst not return to their wives and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And having tarried in the wilderness, and having discovered the daughters of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when there were but few of them gathered together to dance, they came forth out of their secret places and took them and carried them into the wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the daughters of the Lamanites they carried into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that their daughters had been missing, they were angry with the people of Limhi, for they thought it was the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea, even the king himself went before his people; and they went up to the land of Nephi to destroy the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now Limhi had discovered them from the tower, even all their preparations for war did he discover; therefore he gathered his people together, and laid wait for them in the fields and in the forests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had come up, that the people of Limhi began to fall upon them from their waiting places, and began to slay them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the battle became exceedingly sore, for they fought like lions for their prey.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as the Lamanites.  But they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites among the number of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him before Limhi, and said: Behold, here is the king of the Lamanites; he having received a wound has fallen among their dead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him before you; and now let us slay him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring him hither that I may see him.  And they brought him.  And Limhi said unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my people?  Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now the king said: I have broken the oath because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter; therefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever has done this thing shall perish.  Therefore he caused a search to be made among his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now when Gideon had heard these things, he being the king&#x2019;s captain, he went forth and said unto the king: I pray thee forbear, and do not search this people, and lay not this thing to their charge.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, whom this people sought to destroy?  And are they not in the wilderness?  And are not they the ones who have stolen the daughters of the Lamanites?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, behold, and tell the king of these things, that he may tell his people that they may be pacified towards us; for behold they are already preparing to come against us; and behold also there are but few of us.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And behold, they come with their numerous hosts; and except the king doth pacify them towards us we must perish.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled, which he prophesied against us&#x2014;and all this because we would not hearken unto the words of the Lord, and turn from our iniquities?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil the oath which we have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in bondage than that we should lose our lives; therefore, let us put a stop to the shedding of so much blood.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now Limhi told the king all the things concerning his father, and the priests that had fled into the wilderness, and attributed the carrying away of their daughters to them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that the king was pacified towards his people; and he said unto them: Let us go forth to meet my people, without arms; and I swear unto you with an oath that my people shall not slay thy people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went forth without arms to meet the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites did bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_20.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi, that they were without arms, they had compassion on them and were pacified towards them, and returned with their king in peace to their own land.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_22.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to consult with the people how they should deliver themselves out of bondage; and even they did cause that all the people should gather themselves together; and this they did that they might have the voice of the people concerning the matter.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver themselves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and children, and their flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and depart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so numerous, it was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them, thinking to deliver themselves out of bondage by the sword.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and stood before the king, and said unto him: Now O king, thou hast hitherto hearkened unto my words many times when we have been contending with our brethren, the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be an unprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even so I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time, and I will be thy servant and deliver this people out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the king granted unto him that he might speak.  And Gideon said unto him:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of the city.  The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by night are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And I will go according to thy command and pay the last tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and we will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp when they are drunken and asleep.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our flocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel around the land of Shilom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of Gideon.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And king Limhi caused that his people should gather their flocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto them; and they did drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart by night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds, and they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And they had taken all their gold, and silver, and their precious things, which they could carry, and also their provisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their journey.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And after being many days in the wilderness they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah&#x2019;s people, and became his subjects.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and he also received their records, and also the records which had been found by the people of Limhi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the people of Limhi had departed out of the land by night, that they sent an army into the wilderness to pursue them;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_22.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after they had pursued them two days, they could no longer follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in the wilderness.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_21.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Yea, all this was done that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now the afflictions of the Nephites were great, and there was no way that they could deliver themselves out of their hands, for the Lamanites had surrounded them on every side.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that the people began to murmur with the king because of their afflictions; and they began to be desirous to go against them to battle.  And they did afflict the king sorely with their complaints; therefore he granted unto them that they should do according to their desires.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they gathered themselves together again, and put on their armor, and went forth against the Lamanites to drive them out of their land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat them, and drove them back, and slew many of them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now there was a great mourning and lamentation among the people of Limhi, the widow mourning for her husband, the son and the daughter mourning for their father, and the brothers for their brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now there were a great many widows in the land, and they did cry mightily from day to day, for a great fear of the Lamanites had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up the remainder of the people of Limhi to anger against the Lamanites; and they went again to battle, but they were driven back again, suffering much loss.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Yea, they went again even the third time, and suffered in the like manner; and those that were not slain returned again to the city of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And they did humble themselves even to the dust, subjecting themselves to the yoke of bondage, submitting themselves to be smitten, and to be driven to and fro, and burdened, according to the desires of their enemies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And they did humble themselves even in the depths of humility; and they did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day long did they cry unto their God that he would deliver them out of their afflictions.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease their burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that they began to prosper by degrees in the land, and began to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks, and herds, that they did not suffer with hunger.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of men; therefore king Limhi commanded that every man should impart to the support of the widows and their children, that they might not perish with hunger; and this they did because of the greatness of their number that had been slain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now the people of Limhi kept together in a body as much as it was possible, and secured their grain and their flocks;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And the king himself did not trust his person without the walls of the city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing that he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And he caused that his people should watch the land round about, that by some means they might take those priests that fled into the wilderness, who had stolen the daughters of the Lamanites, and that had caused such a great destruction to come upon them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> For they were desirous to take them that they might punish them; for they had come into the land of Nephi by night, and carried off their grain and many of their precious things; therefore they laid wait for them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that there was no more disturbance between the Lamanites and the people of Limhi, even until the time that Ammon and his brethren came into the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the king having been without the gates of the city with his guard, discovered Ammon and his brethren; and supposing them to be priests of Noah therefore he caused that they should be taken, and bound, and cast into prison.  And had they been the priests of Noah he would have caused that they should be put to death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> But when he found that they were not, but that they were his brethren, and had come from the land of Zarahemla, he was filled with exceedingly great joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now king Limhi had sent, previous to the coming of Ammon, a small number of men to search for the land of Zarahemla; but they could not find it, and they were lost in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled; yea, a land which was covered with dry bones; yea, a land which had been peopled and which had been destroyed; and they, having supposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of Nephi, having arrived in the borders of the land not many days before the coming of Ammon.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And they brought a record with them, even a record of the people whose bones they had found; and it was engraven on plates of ore.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now Limhi was again filled with joy on learning from the mouth of Ammon that king Mosiah had a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such engravings; yea, and Ammon also did rejoice.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Yet Ammon and his brethren were filled with sorrow because so many of their brethren had been slain;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also did mourn for the death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of Alma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the words which had been spoken by Abinadi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not whither they had fled.  Now they would have gladly joined with them, for they themselves had entered into a covenant with God to serve him and keep his commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now since the coming of Ammon, king Limhi had also entered into a covenant with God, and also many of his people, to serve him and keep his commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of his people were desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that had authority from God.  And Ammon declined doing this thing, considering himself an unworthy servant.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a church, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord.  Now they were desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> They were desirous to be baptized as a witness and a testimony that they were willing to serve God with all their hearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time; and an account of their baptism shall be given hereafter.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_21.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And now all the study of Ammon and his people, and king Limhi and his people, was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the Lamanites and from bondage.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_24.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed teachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the land of Amulon.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For the Lamanites had taken possession of all these lands; therefore, the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over all these lands.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now the name of the king of the Lamanites was Laman, being called after the name of his father; and therefore he was called king Laman.  And he was king over a numerous people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he appointed teachers of the brethren of Amulon in every land which was possessed by his people; and thus the language of Nephi began to be taught among all the people of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they were a people friendly one with another; nevertheless they knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them anything concerning the Lord their God, neither the law of Moses; nor did they teach them the words of Abinadi;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But they taught them that they should keep their record, and that they might write one to another.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began to trade one with another and wax great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were among their own brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now it came to pass that Amulon began to exercise authority over Alma and his brethren, and began to persecute him, and cause that his children should persecute their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king&#x2019;s priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth with him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put task-masters over them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he put guards over them to watch them, that whosoever should be found calling upon God should be put to death.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go before this people, and I will go with thee and deliver this people out of bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now it came to pass that Alma and his people in the night-time gathered their flocks together, and also of their grain; yea, even all the night-time were they gathering their flocks together.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon the Lamanites, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound sleep.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And Alma and his people departed into the wilderness; and when they had traveled all day they pitched their tents in a valley, and they called the valley Alma, because he led their way in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their thanks to God because he had been merciful unto them, and eased their burdens, and had delivered them out of bondage; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it were the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And they gave thanks to God, yea, all their men and all their women and all their children that could speak lifted their voices in the praises of their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and get thou and this people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will stop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in pursuit of this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that they departed out of the valley, and took their journey into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_24.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And after they had been in the wilderness twelve days they arrived in the land of Zarahemla; and king Mosiah did also receive them with joy.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_23.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord that the armies of king Noah would come upon them, and having made it known to his people, therefore they gathered together their flocks, and took of their grain, and departed into the wilderness before the armies of king Noah.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the Lord did strengthen them, that the people of king Noah could not overtake them to destroy them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they fled eight days&#x2019; journey into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and pleasant land, a land of pure water.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground, and began to build buildings; yea, they were industrious, and did labor exceedingly.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And the people were desirous that Alma should be their king, for he was beloved by his people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye should have a king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could always have just men to be your kings it would be well for you to have a king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his priests; and I myself was caught in a snare, and did many things which were abominable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore repentance;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Nevertheless, after much tribulation, the Lord did hear my cries, and did answer my prayers, and has made me an instrument in his hands in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his truth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, in this I do not glory, for I am unworthy to glory of myself.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And also trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man should love his neighbor as himself, that there should be no contention among them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, Alma was their high priest, he being the founder of their church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that none received authority to preach or to teach except it were by him from God.  Therefore he consecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none were consecrated except they were just men.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Therefore they did watch over their people, and did nourish them with things pertaining to righteousness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in the land; and they called the land Helam.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that they did multiply and prosper exceedingly in the land of Helam; and they built a city, which they called the city of Helam.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Nevertheless&#x2014;whosoever putteth his trust in him the same shall be lifted up at the last day.  Yea, and thus it was with this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, I will show unto you that they were brought into bondage, and none could deliver them but the Lord their God, yea, even the God of Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that he did deliver them, and he did show forth his mighty power unto them, and great were their rejoicings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For behold, it came to pass that while they were in the land of Helam, yea, in the city of Helam, while tilling the land round about, behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma fled from their fields, and gathered themselves together in the city of Helam; and they were much frightened because of the appearance of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened, but that they should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they would spare them, and their wives, and their children.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites.  And Alma and his brethren went forth and delivered themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession of the land of Helam.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Now the armies of the Lamanites, which had followed after the people of king Limhi, had been lost in the wilderness for many days.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And behold, they had found those priests of king Noah, in a place which they called Amulon; and they had begun to possess the land of Amulon and had begun to till the ground.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now the name of the leader of those priests was Amulon.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that Amulon did plead with the Lamanites; and he also sent forth their wives, who were the daughters of the Lamanites, to plead with their brethren, that they should not destroy their husbands.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And the Lamanites had compassion on Amulon and his brethren, and did not destroy them, because of their wives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And Amulon and his brethren did join the Lamanites, and they were traveling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi when they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And it came to pass that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and his brethren, that if they would show them the way which led to the land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and their liberty.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But after Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of Nephi the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set guards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a part of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with them the wives and the children of the guards who had been left in the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_23.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the land of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do anything contrary to the will of the king of the Lamanites.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_25.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now king Mosiah caused that all the people should be gathered together.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now there were not so many of the children of Nephi, or so many of those who were descendants of Nephi, as there were of the people of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who came with him into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And there were not so many of the people of Nephi and of the people of Zarahemla as there were of the Lamanites; yea, they were not half so numerous.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now all the people of Nephi were assembled together, and also all the people of Zarahemla, and they were gathered together in two bodies.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be read, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the records of the people of Zeniff, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until they returned again.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he also read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all their afflictions, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until the time they returned again.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading the records, his people who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and amazement.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those that had been delivered out of bondage they were filled with exceedingly great joy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again, when they thought of their brethren who had been slain by the Lamanites they were filled with sorrow, and even shed many tears of sorrow.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites and of bondage, they did raise their voices and give thanks to God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And again, when they thought upon the Lamanites, who were their brethren, of their sinful and polluted state, they were filled with pain and anguish for the welfare of their souls.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that those who were the children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the daughters of the Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those who were called Nephites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now all the people of Zarahemla were numbered with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but those who were descendants of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should also speak to the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled together in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all those that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people many things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king Limhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people were desirous that they might be baptized also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that he might establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now this was done because there were so many people that they could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God in one assembly;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Therefore they did assemble themselves together in different bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were all one church, yea, even the church of God; for there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of God;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_25.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And they were called the people of God.  And the Lord did pour out his Spirit upon them, and they were blessed, and prospered in the land.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_26.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the church.  And they were a separate people as to their faith, and remained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state; for they would not call upon the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous as the people of God; but because of the dissensions among the brethren they became more numerous.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their flattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by the church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests, and delivered up unto the priests by the teachers; and the priests brought them before Alma, who was the high priest.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the church.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that Alma did not know concerning them; but there were many witnesses against them; yea, the people stood and testified of their iniquity in abundance.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now there had not any such thing happened before in the church; therefore Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have brought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and they have been taken in divers iniquities.  And they do not repent of their iniquities; therefore we have brought them before thee, that thou mayest judge them according to their crimes.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge them not; therefore I deliver them into thy hands to be judged.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this matter, for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole soul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Blessed art thou, Alma, and blessed are they who were baptized in the waters of Mormon.  Thou art blessed because of thy exceeding faith in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And blessed are they because of their exceeding faith in the words alone which thou hast spoken unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And blessed art thou because thou hast established a church among this people; and they shall be established, and they shall be my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name; for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And because thou hast inquired of me concerning the transgressor, thou art blessed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt have eternal life; and thou shalt serve me and go forth in my name, and shalt gather together my sheep.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he that will hear my voice shall be my sheep; and him shall ye receive into the church, and him will I also receive.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> For behold, this is my church; whosoever is baptized shall be baptized unto repentance.  And whomsoever ye receive shall believe in my name; and him will I freely forgive.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is I that hath created them; and it is I that granteth unto him that believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, in my name are they called; and if they know me they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my right hand.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it shall come to pass that when the second trump shall sound then shall they that never knew me come forth and shall stand before me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, that I am their Redeemer; but they would not be redeemed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And then I will confess unto them that I never knew them; and they shall depart into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I will not receive at the last day.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses; for verily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor&#x2019;s trespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemnation.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered among my people; and this shall be observed from this time forward.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass when Alma had heard these words he wrote them down that he might have them, and that he might judge the people of that church according to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Alma went and judged those that had been taken in iniquity, according to the word of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And whosoever repented of their sins and did confess them, them he did number among the people of the church;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And those that would not confess their sins and repent of their iniquity, the same were not numbered among the people of the church, and their names were blotted out.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of the church; and they began again to have peace and to prosper exceedingly in the affairs of the church, walking circumspectly before God, receiving many, and baptizing many.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And now all these things did Alma and his fellow laborers do who were over the church, walking in all diligence, teaching the word of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being persecuted by all those who did not belong to the church of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_26.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And they did admonish their brethren; and they were also admonished, every one by the word of God, according to his sins, or to the sins which he had committed, being commanded of God to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_27.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that the persecutions which were inflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma.  And Alma laid the case before their king, Mosiah.  And Mosiah consulted with his priests.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the land round about that there should not any unbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And there was a strict command throughout all the churches that there should be no persecutions among them, that there should be an equality among all men;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> That they should let no pride nor haughtiness disturb their peace; that every man should esteem his neighbor as himself, laboring with their own hands for their support.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and all their priests and teachers should labor with their own hands for their support, in all cases save it were in sickness, or in much want; and doing these things, they did abound in the grace of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the people began to be very numerous, and began to scatter abroad upon the face of the earth, yea, on the north and on the south, on the east and on the west, building large cities and villages in all quarters of the land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the Lord did visit them and prosper them, and they became a large and wealthy people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man.  And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now it came to pass that while he was going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God?  For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God?  For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth?  And can ye not also behold me before you?  And I am sent from God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in bondage, and he has delivered them.  And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now it came to pass that these were the last words which the angel spake unto Alma, and he departed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the earth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together that they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for those that were with him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might receive their strength&#x2014;that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity.  I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God.  My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto all.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him.  Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_27.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And how blessed are they!  For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_28.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners.  And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that Mosiah granted that they might go and do according to their request.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And they took their journey into the wilderness to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an account of their proceedings hereafter.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who would accept of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and all the things which he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of God, after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the plates of gold which had been found by the people of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people; for they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those people who had been destroyed.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now he translated them by the means of those two stones which were fastened into the two rims of a bow.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now these things were prepared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And they have been kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he should discover to every creature who should possess the land the iniquities and abominations of his people;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And whosoever has these things is called seer, after the manner of old times.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records, behold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And this account shall be written hereafter; for behold, it is expedient that all people should know the things which are written in this account.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_28.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 7</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="mosiah_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that on the morrow they started to go up, having with them one Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man, and a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the wilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they wander.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And when they had wandered forty days they came to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched their tents.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the land of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were surrounded by the king&#x2019;s guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were committed to prison.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were again brought before the king, and their bands were loosed; and they stood before the king, and were permitted, or rather commanded, that they should answer the questions which he should ask them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have caused that my guards should have put you to death.  Ye are permitted to speak.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he went forth and bowed himself before the king; and rising again he said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am yet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to speak with boldness;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these bands.  For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive.  And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne.  And now, behold, our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon nor his brethren, but caused that they should go to the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest themselves from the labors of their journey; for they had suffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather themselves together to the temple, to hear the words which he should speak unto them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves together that he spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be made.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even until now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection or into bondage.  And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now, is not this grievous to be borne?  And is not this, our affliction, great?  Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon them.  But behold, they would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among them, even so much that they did shed blood among themselves.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and said that he should take upon him the image of man, and it should be the image after which man was created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was created after the image of God, and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and many more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God upon them.  Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And again, he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the chaff thereof in the whirlwind; and the effect thereof is poison.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And again he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are smitten and afflicted.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_7.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.</li>

            <li id="mosiah_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now when the king had heard these words, he said unto his priests: Away with this fellow, and slay him; for what have we to do with him, for he is mad.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they stood forth and attempted to lay their hands on him; but he withstood them, and said unto them:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested that I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But I must fulfil the commandments wherewith God has commanded me; and because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me.  And again, because I have spoken the word of God ye have judged me that I am mad.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken these words that the people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on him, for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him; and his face shone with exceeding luster, even as Moses&#x2019; did while in the mount of Sinai, while speaking with the Lord.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And he spake with power and authority from God; and he continued his words, saying:</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Ye see that ye have not power to slay me, therefore I finish my message. Yea, and I perceive that it cuts you to your hearts because I tell you the truth concerning your iniquities.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Yea, and my words fill you with wonder and amazement, and with anger.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But I finish my message; and then it matters not whither I go, if it so be that I am saved.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But this much I tell you, what you do with me, after this, shall be as a type and a shadow of things which are to come.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now I read unto you the remainder of the commandments of God, for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts; I perceive that ye have studied and taught iniquity the most part of your lives.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of things which are in heaven above, or which are in the earth beneath, or which are in the water under the earth.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And again: Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord thy God, thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Thou shalt not kill.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Thou shalt not commit adultery.  Thou shalt not steal.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor&#x2019;s.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that after Abinadi had made an end of these sayings that he said unto them: Have ye taught this people that they should observe to do all these things for to keep these commandments?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord would not have caused me to come forth and to prophesy evil concerning this people.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of Moses.  I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there should be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very strict law; for they were a stiffnecked people, quick to do iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were types of things to come.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now, did they understand the law?  I say unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law; and this because of the hardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God.</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them concerning the coming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people?  Yea, and even all the prophets who have prophesied ever since the world began&#x2014;have they not spoken more or less concerning these things?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Have they not said that God himself should come down among the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?</li>
            <li id="mosiah_13.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Yea, and have they not said also that he should bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, should be oppressed and afflicted?</li>

<p data-aid="154070659" id="p1">Large fires can start from a single spark. Abinadi was only one man testifying against a powerful king and his court. His words were rejected for the most part, and he was sentenced to death. Yet his testimony of Jesus Christ, who is the &#x201C;light &#x2026; that can never be darkened&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p9#p9">Mosiah 16:9</a>), sparked something inside the young priest Alma. And that spark of conversion slowly grew as Alma brought many others to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The flames that killed Abinadi eventually died out, but the fire of faith that his words created would have a lasting influence on the Nephites&#x2014;and on people who read his words today. Most of us will never face quite what Abinadi did because of our testimonies, but we all have moments when following Jesus Christ is a test of our courage and faith. Perhaps studying Abinadi&#x2019;s testimony will fan the flames of testimony and courage in your heart as well.</p>

<p data-aid="154070725" id="p3">While you&#x2019;re studying <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11?lang=eng">Mosiah 11&#x2013;13</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng">17</a>, look at the pictures of Abinadi in this outline. What do you learn about standing as a witness for Christ? In particular, you could focus your study on passages and questions like these:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154070738" id="p4">How would you describe Noah and his people? Why would it require courage for Abinadi to share God&#x2019;s message with them? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p19,27-p29#p1">Mosiah 11:1&#x2013;19, 27&#x2013;29</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p9-p15#p9">12:9&#x2013;15</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070748" id="p5">How would you describe Abinadi? What did Abinadi understand that helped him be bold in his testimony? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p2-p9,28,33-p35#p2">Mosiah 13:2&#x2013;9, 28, 33&#x2013;35</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng&amp;id=p8-p10,20#p8">17:8&#x2013;10,&#xA0;20</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154070756" id="p6">When have you felt like you were standing alone in defense of the Savior and His gospel? How did He help you feel He was with you? As you ponder this, you could read the account of Elisha and his young servant in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/6?lang=eng&amp;id=p14-p17#p14">2&#xA0;Kings 6:14&#x2013;17</a>. What inspires you about this account?</p>
<p data-aid="154070765" id="p7">You could also search <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/for-the-strength-of-youth/07-truth?lang=eng">pages 31&#x2013;33</a> of <cite>For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices</cite> to find phrases that give you courage to defend the truth. Or you could do the same in the lyrics of a hymn like &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/do-what-is-right?lang=eng">Do What Is Right</a>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/let-us-all-press-on?lang=eng">Let Us All Press On</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, nos.&#xA0;237,&#xA0;243).</p>
<p data-aid="154070774" id="p8">How will you apply what you learned from Abinadi? The video &#x201C;Dare to Stand Alone&#x201D; (Gospel Library) portrays situations in which you can stand for Christ and His gospel. What other examples can you think of?</p>

Generations had passed, and Mosiah&#x2019;s people had heard nothing from them. So, Mosiah asked Ammon to lead a search party to find the Nephites who had left. The search party found that these Nephites, &#x201C;because of iniquity&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p24#p24">Mosiah 7:24</a>), were in captivity to the Lamanites. But with the arrival of Ammon and his brethren, suddenly there was hope for deliverance.</p>
<p data-aid="154070635" id="p2">Sometimes we&#x2019;re like these captive Nephites, suffering because of our sins, wondering how we&#x2019;ll ever find peace again.

Then you could read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p19#p19">Mosiah 7:19</a> to them and review the stories mentioned in this verse (see &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/old-testament-stories/chapter-17-the-passover?lang=eng">The Passover</a>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/old-testament-stories/chapter-18-the-israelites-in-the-wilderness?lang=eng">The Israelites in the Wilderness</a>&#x201D; in <cite>Old Testament Stories</cite>, 70&#x2013;76). Maybe your children would like to act them out. How did the Lord help the people in these stories? How can He help us?</p>

<p data-aid="154070934" id="p21">For more examples of how the Lord helps us, select some verses of &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/childrens-songbook/book-of-mormon-stories?lang=eng">Book of Mormon Stories</a>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/childrens-songbook/nephis-courage?lang=eng">Nephi&#x2019;s Courage</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Children&#x2019;s Songbook</cite>, 118&#x2013;19, 120&#x2013;21) to sing with your children.

<p data-aid="154069167" id="p1">Have you ever heard someone speak and felt inspired to change your life? Perhaps you decided, because of what you heard, to live a little differently&#x2014;or even a lot differently. King Benjamin&#x2019;s sermon was that kind of sermon, and the truths he taught had that kind of effect on the people who heard them. King Benjamin shared with his people what an angel had taught him&#x2014;that wonderful blessings were possible through &#x201C;the atoning blood of Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 4:2</a>). Because of His message, they changed their view of themselves (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 4:2</a>), the Spirit changed their desires (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Mosiah 5:2</a>), and they covenanted with God that they would always do His will (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5">Mosiah 5:5</a>). This is how King Benjamin&#x2019;s words affected his people. How will they affect you?</p>

<p data-aid="154069190" id="p2">Sometimes, even when you have felt forgiven of your sins, you might struggle to keep that feeling and stay on the path of righteousness. King Benjamin taught his people how to both receive and retain a remission of sins. As you study <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng">chapter&#xA0;4</a> of Mosiah, consider asking questions like these:</p>

<p data-aid="154069257" id="p11">King Benjamin&#x2019;s invitation to believe in and trust God is as important today as it was in ancient times. As you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p10#p5">Mosiah 4:5&#x2013;10</a>, look for truths about God that give you reason to trust Him.

Why would trusting God make it easier to do what King Benjamin invites?</p>

What are some reasons people might not want to serve others? What could we say to someone to invite them to help people in need? Look for ideas in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p16-p26#p16">Mosiah 4:16&#x2013;26</a>.</p>

This leads us to be loving and kind toward others.

Yes, the journey back to Heavenly Father is individual, and no one can keep our covenants for us, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean we are alone. We need each other.

<p data-aid="154070759" id="p2">Consider how deeply the believers described in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng">Mosiah&#xA0;18</a> felt about Jesus Christ. They had to meet secretly, at great risk, to learn about Him (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">verse&#xA0;3</a>). And when given the chance to show their commitment by the covenant of baptism, &#x201C;they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">Mosiah 18:11</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154070767" id="p3">Reading these verses could be a good opportunity to ponder how important your covenants are to you.

<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154070776" id="p4">What do you learn from these verses about the promises you made at baptism? What does God promise you? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p10,13#p10">verses&#xA0;10,&#xA0;13</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070785" id="p5">How does the covenant to serve God relate to our efforts to minister to one another? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p8-p9#p8">verses 8&#x2013;9</a>).</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154070813" id="p8">Answering these questions might lead you to ponder why covenants and ordinances are important to God. You could find insights in Elder Gerrit&#xA0;W.

<p data-aid="154070935" id="p17">One important way to help your children prepare for baptism is to teach them about the covenant they will make when they are baptized. This could be as simple as showing the picture at the end of this week&#x2019;s outline and reading about the covenant with them in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p9-p10#p9">Mosiah 18:9&#x2013;10</a>. Consider inviting a child who has already been baptized to teach this to the younger children. Your children might enjoy hearing about your baptism. How has keeping your covenants with God blessed your life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070939" id="p18">Children who have been baptized could use frequent reminders about the covenants they made and renew each week with the sacrament. Perhaps your children could compare the baptismal covenant described in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p8-p10#p8">Mosiah 18:8&#x2013;10</a> with the sacrament prayers (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&amp;id=p77,79#p77">Doctrine and Covenants 20:77,&#xA0;79</a>). How can we make the sacrament a special, reverent time, just like our baptisms were?</p>

<p data-aid="154070970" id="p21">A simple object lesson can make learning more memorable. Consider filling a bag with heavy objects (to represent burdens) and inviting a child to hold the bag. As you read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng&amp;id=p8-p17#p8">Mosiah 24:8&#x2013;17</a> with your children, ask them to remove an item from the bag every time they hear about something Alma and his people did to seek God&#x2019;s help with their burdens.
