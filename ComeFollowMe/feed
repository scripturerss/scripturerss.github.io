            <li id="2 ne_32.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way.  But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ.  Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh.  And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing.  For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_32.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_33.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people.  For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people.  And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the words which I have written save he shall be of the spirit of the devil.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> I have charity for my people, and great faith in Christ that I shall meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> I have charity for the Jew&#x2014;I say Jew, because I mean them from whence I came.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> I also have charity for the Gentiles.  But behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ.  And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye&#x2014;for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall come.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last day.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_33.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must obey.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_29.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> But behold, there shall be many&#x2014;at that day when I shall proceed to do a marvelous work among them, that I may remember my covenants which I have made unto the children of men, that I may set my hand again the second time to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember your seed; and that the words of your seed should proceed forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And because my words shall hiss forth&#x2014;many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible!  A Bible!  We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people.  And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them?  Yea, what do the Gentiles mean?  Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people?  Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them.  But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible.  Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Know ye not that there are more nations than one?  Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word?  Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another?  Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another.  And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words according to mine own pleasure.  And because that I have spoken one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_29.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one.  And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 31</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_31.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren.  And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men.  For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Know ye not that he was holy?  But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me.  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism&#x2014;yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful.  He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter.  For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.  Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_31.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.  And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end.  Amen.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now, behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you, according as the Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I know that they must surely come to pass.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the things which shall be written out of the book shall be of great worth unto the children of men, and especially unto our seed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am the Lord&#x2019;s; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lord&#x2019;s; and thus shall every one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord&#x2014;</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they shall say there is a miracle wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for this day he is not a God of miracles; he hath done his work.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_28.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false doctrines, and all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord, wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord God Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught and revile against that which is good, and say that it is of no worth!

            <li id="2 ne_28.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well&#x2014;and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none&#x2014;and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_28.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_30.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now behold, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you; for I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye should suppose that ye are more righteous than the Gentiles shall be.  For behold, except ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall all likewise perish; and because of the words which have been spoken ye need not suppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles.  For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And then shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them; wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a pure and a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to gather in upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe in Christ shall also become a delightsome people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his work among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration of his people upon the earth.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth.  And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a great division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy; and he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the wicked by fire.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice&#x2019;s den.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_30.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time.  And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_1.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> For behold, it came to pass that fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates, upon which these things are engraven.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation which was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the heads of them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for Christ&#x2019;s sake, and for the sake of our people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people, what things should happen unto them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ and his kingdom, which should come.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to come unto Christ, and partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die; wherefore, he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now, according to the reigns of the kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> The people having loved Nephi exceedingly, he having been a great protector for them, having wielded the sword of Laban in their defence, and having labored in all his days for their welfare&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name.  And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name they would.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that Nephi died.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solomon, his son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Yea, and they also began to search much gold and silver, and began to be lifted up somewhat in pride.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the Lord.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated priests and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="jacob_1.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.</li>

            <li id="jacob_2.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> The words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi, spake unto the people of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, and that I might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you the word of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been diligent in the office of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with much more desire and anxiety for the welfare of your souls than I have hitherto been.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the Lord, which I have given unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth I can tell you concerning your thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in sin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and abominable unto God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame before the presence of my Maker, that I must testify unto you concerning the wickedness of your hearts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And also it grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech concerning you, before your wives and your children, many of whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate before God, which thing is pleasing unto God;</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the pleasing word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded soul.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained, because of the strict commandment which I have received from God, to admonish you according to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds of those who are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing their wounds; and those who have not been wounded, instead of feasting upon the pleasing word of God have daggers placed to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do according to the strict commands of God, and tell you concerning your wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in heart, and the broken heart, and under the glance of the piercing eye of the Almighty God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the plainness of the word of God.  For behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying: Jacob, get thou up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall give thee unto this people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare unto you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for silver, and for all manner of precious ores, in the which this land, which is a land of promise unto you and to your seed, doth abound most plentifully.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly, that you have obtained many riches; and because some of you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better than they.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now, my brethren, do ye suppose that God justifieth you in this thing?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay.  But he condemneth you, and if ye persist in these things his judgments must speedily come unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> O that he would show you that he can pierce you, and with one glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust!</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> O that he would rid you from this iniquity and abomination.  And, O that ye would listen unto the word of his commands, and let not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls!</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good&#x2014;to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you concerning pride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him because ye were proud in your hearts, of the things which God hath given you, what say ye of it?</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him who created all flesh?  And the one being is as precious in his sight as the other.  And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments and glorify him forever.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this pride.  And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a grosser crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly because of you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes.  For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women.  And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out of the land of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms, like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments were given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them before; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things which ye ought not to have done.</li>
            <li id="jacob_2.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren.  Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you.  And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.</li>

            <li id="jacob_3.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart.  Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down justice upon those who seek your destruction.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy this day before God; for except ye repent the land is cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you, nevertheless they are cursed with a sore cursing, shall scourge you even unto destruction.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead away the righteous out from among you.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father&#x2014;that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed people.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may not become angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second death.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi, warning them against fornication and lasciviousness, and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which now began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these plates; but many of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates, and their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their kings.</li>
            <li id="jacob_3.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by the hand of Nephi.  And I make an end of speaking these words.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="jacob_4.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered much unto my people in word, (and I cannot write but a little of my words, because of the difficulty of engraving our words upon plates) and we know that the things which we write upon plates must remain;</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon plates must perish and vanish away; but we can write a few words upon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved brethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or concerning their fathers&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first parents.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his name. And for this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do these things.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord.  How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways.  And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word.  Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand.  For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through the atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things; for why not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the understanding of men; for the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not.  Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls.  But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also spake them unto prophets of old.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they despised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and sought for things that they could not understand.  Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall; for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things which they cannot understand, because they desired it.  And because they desired it God hath done it, that they may stumble.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying; for I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that by the stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they might build and have safe foundation.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But behold, according to the scriptures, this stone shall become the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon which the Jews can build.</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that it may become the head of their corner?</li>
            <li id="jacob_4.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this mystery unto you; if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_25.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah.  For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the word which he hath spoken.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy.  But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the words unto mine own people; for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last days; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them, immediately after my father left Jerusalem; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those which are carried away captive into Babylon.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And now this I speak because of the spirit which is in me. And notwithstanding they have been carried away they shall return again, and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall be restored again to the land of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is laid in a sepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God.  Wherefore, my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the people of his church.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered by other nations.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations, yea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which is infinite for all mankind&#x2014;and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with pure hearts and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the day will come that it must needs be expedient that they should believe these things.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state.  Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given them for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which should deceive the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err.  And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be judged of them according to the words which are written.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may know the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness of the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ, and know for what end the law was given.  And after the law is fulfilled in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts against him when the law ought to be done away.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people; wherefore, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand.  And the words which I have spoken shall stand as a testimony against you; for they are sufficient to teach any man the right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_25.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And, inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the performances and ordinances of God until the law shall be fulfilled which was given unto Moses.</li>

            <li id="2 ne_27.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles&#x2014;yea, behold all the nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those who shall come upon this land and those who shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the earth, behold, they will be drunken with iniquity and all manner of abominations&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise, and with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye shall be drunken but not with wine, ye shall stagger but not with strong drink.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep.  For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have rejected the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of your iniquity.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the words of a book, and they shall be the words of them which have slumbered.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations of the people.  Wherefore the book shall be kept from them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words of the book, which are the words of those who have slumbered in the dust, and he shall deliver these words unto another;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But the words which are sealed he shall not deliver, neither shall he deliver the book.  For the book shall be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for behold, they reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may show them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee.  And the learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now, because of the glory of the world and to get gain will they say this, and not for the glory of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is sealed.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that is not learned shall say: I am not learned.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Touch not the things which are sealed, for I will bring them forth in mine own due time; for I will show unto the children of men that I am able to do mine own work.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read, until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And again it shall come to pass that the Lord shall say unto him that shall read the words that shall be delivered him:</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord!  And their works are in the dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and who knoweth us?  And they also say: Surely, your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter&#x2019;s clay.  But behold, I will show unto them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that I know all their works.  For shall the work say of him that made it, he made me not?  Or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, he had no understanding?</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> But behold, saith the Lord of Hosts: I will show unto the children of men that it is yet a very little while and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field; and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And the meek also shall increase, and their joy shall be in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> For assuredly as the Lord liveth they shall see that the terrible one is brought to naught, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And they that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Therefore, thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_27.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="2 ne_26.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And after Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show himself unto you, my children, and my beloved brethren; and the words which he shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye shall do.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many generations shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and contentions among my people.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them; wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against them.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as stubble.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of the earth shall swallow them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; and mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people!  For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways are just.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution&#x2014;behold, they are they which shall not perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But the Son of Righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light, therefore they must go down to hell.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction, and this grieveth my soul.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days; concerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things forth unto the children of men.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them; and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the prayers of the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which shall be done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away&#x2014;yea, thus saith the Lord God: It shall be at an instant, suddenly&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it shall come to pass, that those who have dwindled in unbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And there are many churches built up which cause envyings, and strifes, and malice.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God worketh not in darkness.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.  Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without price.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the synagogues, or out of the houses of worship?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love.  And except they should have charity they were nothing.  Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men should not murder; that they should not lie; that they should not steal; that they should not take the name of the Lord their God in vain; that they should not envy; that they should not have malice; that they should not contend one with another; that they should not commit whoredoms; and that they should do none of these things; for whoso doeth them shall perish.</li>
            <li id="2 ne_26.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.</li>

<p data-aid="154070292" id="p1">The writings of Isaiah include strong warnings, but they also offer hope and joy. This is one reason Nephi included them in his record: &#x201C;I write some of the words of Isaiah,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;that whoso &#x2026; shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.8?lang=eng#p8">2&#xA0;Nephi 11:8</a>). In a sense, the invitation to read Isaiah&#x2019;s writings is an invitation to rejoice. You can take delight, as Nephi did, in Isaiah&#x2019;s prophecies about the gathering of Israel, the coming of the Messiah, and the peace promised to the righteous. You can rejoice to live in the prophesied day when the Lord has &#x201C;set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/21.12?lang=eng#p12">2&#xA0;Nephi 21:12</a>). When you thirst after righteousness, you can &#x201C;with joy &#x2026; draw water out of the wells of salvation&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/22.3?lang=eng#p3">2&#xA0;Nephi 22:3</a>). In other words, you can &#x201C;rejoice in Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#p26">2&#xA0;Nephi 25:26</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154070478" id="p9">Nephi was open about sharing his beliefs&#x2014;especially his testimony of Jesus Christ. Throughout your study of <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng">2&#xA0;Nephi&#xA0;25</a>, think about Nephi&#x2019;s desire to &#x201C;persuade [his] children &#x2026; to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng#p23">verse&#xA0;23</a>).

How did Nephi try to persuade people to believe in Him? (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.19-29?lang=eng#p19">verses 19&#x2013;29</a>). Note passages in this chapter that persuade you to believe in and follow Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="154070499" id="p10">Some of us may not feel as bold as Nephi was about talking of Christ.

For example, Nephi&#x2019;s declaration &#x201C;We rejoice in Christ&#x201D; might prompt you to think about how the Savior brings you joy&#x2014;and how you can share that joy with others.</p>

Help your children understand that an ensign is like a flag. Perhaps they would enjoy drawing their own flag.

<p data-aid="154070494" id="p1">The Nephites considered Nephi their &#x201C;great protector&#x201D; (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.10?lang=eng#p10">Jacob 1:10</a>). He had also protected them against spiritual dangers, warning them against sin and urging them to come unto Christ. Now that task fell to Jacob, whom Nephi had consecrated to be a priest and teacher (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.18?lang=eng#p18">Jacob 1:18</a>). Jacob felt a responsibility to boldly warn those who were &#x201C;beginning to labor in sin&#x201D; while also comforting &#x201C;the wounded soul&#x201D; of those who had been hurt by the sins of others (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.5-9?lang=eng#p5">Jacob 2:5&#x2013;9</a>). How would he do both? He would point them to Jesus Christ&#x2014;because both groups needed the Savior&#x2019;s healing (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng">Jacob&#xA0;4</a>). Like the message of Nephi before him, Jacob&#x2019;s testimony was a call to &#x201C;be reconciled unto [God] through the atonement of Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.11?lang=eng#p11">Jacob 4:11</a>).</p>

<div class="body-block">
<p data-aid="154070471" id="p1">The ancient Apostles were bold in their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His Resurrection (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/acts/4.33?lang=eng#p33">Acts 4:33</a>). Millions of people believe in Jesus Christ and try to follow Him because of their words recorded in the Bible. Yet some people might wonder: If Jesus Christ is the Savior of the whole world, then why were His eyewitnesses limited to a handful of people in one small region?</p>
<p data-aid="154070484" id="p2">The Book of Mormon stands as an additional, convincing witness that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, &#x201C;manifesting himself unto all nations&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng">title page of the Book of Mormon</a>) and offering salvation to all who come unto Him. In addition, this second witness also makes it clear what salvation means. This is why Nephi, Jacob, Mormon, and all the prophets labored so &#x201C;diligently to engraven these words upon plates&#x201D;&#x2014;to declare to future generations that they too &#x201C;knew of Christ, and &#x2026; had a hope of his glory&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.3-4?lang=eng#p3">Jacob 4:3&#x2013;4</a>). This Easter season, reflect on the testimonies in the Book of Mormon that the Savior&#x2019;s power is both universal and personal&#x2014;redeeming the whole world and redeeming you.</p>

<p data-aid="154070521" id="p3">It&#x2019;s traditional at Easter to ponder the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, but what exactly does it mean to be resurrected? What insights does the Book of Mormon offer about resurrection? Perhaps this Easter season you could list truths about resurrection that you find in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.6-15,22?lang=eng#p6">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:6&#x2013;15,&#xA0;22</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.42-45?lang=eng#p42">Alma 11:42&#x2013;45</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.21-25?lang=eng#p21">40:21&#x2013;25</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.4-5?lang=eng#p4">3&#xA0;Nephi 26:4&#x2013;5</a>.</p>
<p data-aid="154070533" id="p4">You could also record how these truths about resurrection influence your actions and the way you live. For example, consider how you would complete these sentences: <i>If I did not know these things&#xA0;&#x2026;</i> and <i>Because I know these things&#xA0;&#x2026;</i></p>
<p data-aid="154070547" id="p5">A hymn like &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/hymns/i-know-that-my-redeemer-lives?lang=eng">I Know That My Redeemer Lives</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Hymns</cite>, no.&#xA0;136) could help you think about why the Savior&#x2019;s Resurrection is important to you. As you sing, listen to, or read the hymn, you might ask yourself, &#x201C;How is my life different because Jesus Christ was resurrected?&#x201D;</p>
<p data-aid="154070561" id="p6">The Gospel Library has a collection of <a href="/study/video/easter-videos?lang=eng">Easter videos</a> that could be a meaningful part of your study. Perhaps you could watch one or more of these videos and ponder what they add to your understanding or appreciation of the Savior&#x2019;s Resurrection.</p>

<p data-aid="154070601" id="p8">The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ atoned for our sins. The Book of Mormon expands our understanding of Christ&#x2019;s sacrifice and suffering in important ways. You can find some of these teachings in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.7?lang=eng#p7">Mosiah 3:7</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.5-9?lang=eng#p5">15:5&#x2013;9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13?lang=eng#p11">Alma 7:11&#x2013;13</a>. After you read these passages, consider recording what you discover in a chart like this one:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070612" id="p9">What did the Savior suffer?</p>
</th><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070625" id="p10">Why did He suffer?</p>
</th><th>
<p class="label" data-aid="154070637" id="p11">What does this mean to me?</p>
</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table>
<p data-aid="154070682" id="p12">Here&#x2019;s another way to study these passages: Look for hymns that you feel match the messages they teach. The &#x201C;Scriptures&#x201D; index at the back of the hymnbook can help. What phrases from these hymns and the scriptures help you appreciate the Savior&#x2019;s sacrifice more deeply?</p>

<p data-aid="154070735" id="p14">It could be said that the Book of Mormon is an account of people who changed because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

Or let your children tell you the story, using the pictures in these chapters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070790" id="p18">The Risen Savior&#x2019;s visit to the Americas is a powerful witness of His Resurrection. Consider telling your children about it, using <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng">3&#xA0;Nephi 11</a>;&#xA0;<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng">17</a>; the song &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/childrens-songbook/easter-hosanna?lang=eng">Easter Hosanna</a>&#x201D;; or the last verse of &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/childrens-songbook/book-of-mormon-stories?lang=eng">Book of Mormon Stories</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Children&#x2019;s Songbook</cite>, 68&#x2013;69, 118&#x2013;19). Encourage your children to imagine what it would have been like to feel Jesus&#x2019;s wounds (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.14-15?lang=eng#p14">3&#xA0;Nephi 11:14&#x2013;15</a>) or to be one of the children He blessed (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.21?lang=eng#p21">3&#xA0;Nephi 17:21</a>). Share with each other your feelings about Jesus Christ and His Resurrection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070799" id="p19">To help your children discover what the Book of Mormon teaches about resurrection, you could invite them to pretend that you don&#x2019;t know anything about it and ask them to explain it to you. Help them look in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.10-15?lang=eng#p10">2&#xA0;Nephi 9:10&#x2013;15</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.41-45?lang=eng#p41">Alma 11:41&#x2013;45</a>; and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.21-23?lang=eng#p21">Alma 40:21&#x2013;23</a> for answers to questions like these: What does it mean to be resurrected? Who will be resurrected? Also invite them to bear testimony of the Savior&#x2019;s Resurrection as part of their answer.</p>

<p data-aid="154070853" id="p22">The Book of Mormon gives many examples of people who were changed because of the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement. Perhaps your children could choose one to learn about, such as Enos (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.2-8?lang=eng#p2">Enos 1:2&#x2013;8</a>), Alma the Younger (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.8-24?lang=eng#p8">Mosiah 27:8&#x2013;24</a>), or the Anti-Nephi-Lehies (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.7-19?lang=eng#p7">Alma 24:7&#x2013;19</a>). How did this person or group change because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ? How can we follow their examples?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154070863" id="p23">You and your children could also compare something clean and something dirty and talk about how dirty things are made clean. Read together <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.11-13?lang=eng#p11">Alma 13:11&#x2013;13</a>. What did Jesus do so that we can be made clean from our sins? How does this make us feel about sin? How does it make us feel about the Savior?</p>

<p data-aid="154070372" id="p1">Among Nephi&#x2019;s last recorded words, we find this declaration: &#x201C;The Lord commanded me, and I must obey&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.15?lang=eng#p15">2&#xA0;Nephi 33:15</a>). This is a good summary of Nephi&#x2019;s life. He tried to understand the will of God and courageously obeyed it&#x2014;whether that meant risking his life to get the brass plates from Laban, building a boat and crossing the sea, or faithfully teaching the doctrine of Christ with plainness and power. Nephi could speak persuasively of the need to &#x201C;press forward with a steadfastness in Christ,&#x201D; of following the &#x201C;strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20,18?lang=eng#p20">2&#xA0;Nephi 31:20,&#xA0;18</a>), because that is the path he followed. He knew by experience that this path, though demanding at times, is also joyful, and that &#x201C;there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.21?lang=eng#p21">2&#xA0;Nephi 31:21</a>).</p>

In other words, he was writing about our day. And there&#x2019;s reason to be concerned about what he saw: people denying the power and miracles of God; widespread jealousy and conflict. But in addition to these latter-day &#x201C;works of darkness&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.10,22?lang=eng#p10">2&#xA0;Nephi 26:10,&#xA0;22</a>) led by the adversary, Nephi also spoke of &#x201C;a marvelous work and a wonder&#x201D; led by God Himself (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.26?lang=eng#p26">2&#xA0;Nephi 27:26</a>). Central to that work would be a book&#x2014;a book that exposes Satan&#x2019;s lies and gathers the righteous. That book is the Book of Mormon, the marvelous work is the work of the Lord&#x2019;s Church in the latter days, and the wonder is&#x2014;at least in part&#x2014;that God invites all of us, despite our weaknesses, to participate in the gathering.</p>

<p data-aid="154070832" id="p26">Perhaps you can think of an object lesson that will help your children understand what it means to learn &#x201C;line upon line.&#x201D; For example, they could put together a puzzle or build something with blocks, one piece at a time. Or you could teach them a skill step by step, such as tying a bow or drawing a picture. You could then read <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p30">2&#xA0;Nephi 28:30</a> and discuss how Heavenly Father teaches us one truth at a time.</p>
