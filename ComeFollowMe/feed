        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_8.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the order of the church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself from the labors which he had performed.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek according to the holy order of God, by which he had been called; and he began to teach the people throughout all the land of Melek.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all the borders of the land which was by the wilderness side. And they were baptized throughout all the land;</li>
            <li id="alma_8.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and traveled three days&#x2019; journey on the north of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of Ammonihah he began to preach the word of God unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which was called Aaron.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_8.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from him.  Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them.  Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will destroy them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has given unto his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah.  And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?</li>
            <li id="alma_8.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive.  Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this land forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them concerning their iniquities.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many days.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their iniquities.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people, saying&#x2014;Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and cast into prison.  Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_8.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had given them.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_6.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church who repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance, and were received into the church.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not repent of their wickedness and humble themselves before God&#x2014;I mean those who were lifted up in the pride of their hearts&#x2014;the same were rejected, and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the city of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was liberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of assembling themselves together to hear the word of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather themselves together oft, and join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_6.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church which was established in the valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and the holy order by which he was called.  And thus it is written.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_5.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_5.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers?  Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them?  And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God.  Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they were not.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed?  I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love.  And I say unto you that they are saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved?  Yea, what grounds had they to hope for salvation?  What is the cause of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of hell?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Behold, I can tell you&#x2014;did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi?  And was he not a holy prophet?  Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart.  Behold I say unto you that this is all true.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God.  And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God?  Have ye received his image in your countenances?  Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you?  Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that day, and say&#x2014;Lord, our works have been righteous works upon the face of the earth&#x2014;and that he will save you?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands?  I say unto you, can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have yielded yourselves to become subjects to the devil?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments stained with blood and all manner of filthiness?  Behold, what will these things testify against you?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and also that ye are guilty of all manner of wickedness?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose garments are cleansed and are spotless, pure and white?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the children of the kingdom of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble?  That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Behold, are ye stripped of pride?  I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God.  Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy?  I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent, for the Lord God hath spoken it!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life freely;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth not good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice!</li>
            <li id="alma_5.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye?  Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this?  Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the holy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been spoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> And this is not all.  Do ye not suppose that I know of these things myself?  Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true.  And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God.  Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself.  And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.47" class=""><span class="verse">47</span> And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto me, that the words which have been spoken by our fathers are true, even so according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me, which is also by the manifestation of the Spirit of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.48" class=""><span class="verse">48</span> I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall say unto you, concerning that which is to come, is true; and I say unto you, that I know that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy, and truth.  And behold, it is he that cometh to take away the sins of the world, yea, the sins of every man who steadfastly believeth on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.49" class=""><span class="verse">49</span> And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I am called, yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and every one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.50" class=""><span class="verse">50</span> Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God cometh in his glory, in his might, majesty, power, and dominion.  Yea, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit saith: Behold the glory of the King of all the earth; and also the King of heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of men.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.51" class=""><span class="verse">51</span> And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a mighty voice, saying: Go forth and say unto this people&#x2014;Repent, for except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of heaven.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.52" class=""><span class="verse">52</span> And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is laid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire.  Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.53" class=""><span class="verse">53</span> And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and trample the Holy One under your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing of costly apparel and setting your hearts upon the vain things of the world, upon your riches?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.54" class=""><span class="verse">54</span> Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than another; yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your brethren, who humble themselves and do walk after the holy order of God, wherewith they have been brought into this church, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth works which are meet for repentance&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.55" class=""><span class="verse">55</span> Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the poor, and the needy, and in withholding your substance from them?</li>
            <li id="alma_5.56" class=""><span class="verse">56</span> And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I say unto you that these are they who shall be hewn down and cast into the fire except they speedily repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.57" class=""><span class="verse">57</span> And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold, their names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the righteous, that the word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;</li>
            <li id="alma_5.58" class=""><span class="verse">58</span> For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand.  And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this?  I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.59" class=""><span class="verse">59</span> For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock?  And behold, if a wolf enter his flock doth he not drive him out?  Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.60" class=""><span class="verse">60</span> And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you; and if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you into his fold, and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may not be destroyed.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.61" class=""><span class="verse">61</span> And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_5.62" class=""><span class="verse">62</span> I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 7</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_7.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much business that I could not come unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that the judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come unto you.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea, hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that they are established again in the way of his righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading through much affliction and sorrow.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the true and the living God, and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all&#x2014;for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case.  Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying&#x2014;Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things?  Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the way that I know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of the Spirit which is in me.  And now because your faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken, great is my joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found that my desires have been gratified.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that ye are making his paths straight.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of his word, that he cannot walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal round.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can filthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is filthy shall remain in his filthiness.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have been received.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the holy prophets who have been ever since the world began, having your garments spotless even as their garments are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no more out.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto you according to the Spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul doth exceedingly rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and heed which ye have given unto my word.</li>
            <li id="alma_7.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess, your women and your children, according to your faith and good works, from this time forth and forever.  And thus I have spoken.  Amen.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_9.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_9.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Who art thou?  Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not that the earth should pass away.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did not.  And I stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_9.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of Jerusalem by the hand of God?  Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through the wilderness?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.  But behold, this is not all&#x2014;he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land?  And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence of the Lord.  Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who call on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce anger of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to destroy his people.  I say unto you, Nay; he would rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after having had so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea, after having been favored above every other nation, kindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made known unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which is to come;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of translation;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of things&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_9.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;</li>
            <li id="alma_9.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people and to answer their prayers.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they have been&#x2014;if they have been righteous they shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are meet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost and a fallen people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a fallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they should take me at that time and cast me into prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_9.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to preach unto them also.  And now the words of Amulek are not all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_11.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should receive wages according to the time which they labored to judge those who were brought before them to be judged.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he did owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And the judge received for his wages according to his time&#x2014;a senine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold; and this is according to the law which was given.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold, and of their silver, according to their value.  And the names are given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges, they having been established by king Mosiah.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now the reckoning is thus&#x2014;a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either for a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of grain.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And an onti was as great as them all.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_11.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a measure of barley.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And a leah is the half of a shiblum.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they received their wages according to their employ, therefore, they did stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ, that they might get money according to the suits which were brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I shall ask you?  Now Zeezrom was a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord.  And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me?  Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Believest thou that there is no God?  I say unto you, Nay, thou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more than him.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now thou hast lied before God unto me.  Thou saidst unto me&#x2014;Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto thee&#x2014;when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true and living God, that thou mightest have cause to destroy me.  And now behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy reward.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living God?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And he answered, No.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these things?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come?  Is it the Son of God?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And he said unto him, Yea.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins?  And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people&#x2014;as though he had authority to command God.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he shall not save his people in their sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven?  Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?</li>
            <li id="alma_11.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;</li>
            <li id="alma_11.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.44" class=""><span class="verse">44</span> Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.45" class=""><span class="verse">45</span> Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body.  I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.</li>
            <li id="alma_11.46" class=""><span class="verse">46</span> Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble.  And thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have written.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_13.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And this is the manner after which they were ordained&#x2014;being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world for such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter into his rest&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of all things&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> Now they were ordained after this manner&#x2014;being called with a holy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and high priesthood, is without beginning or end&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is.  Amen.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood, there were many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were sanctified, and their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and there were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before God, and bring forth fruit meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into that rest.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek, who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people.  And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now, there were many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but none were greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made mention.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice.  Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest them it shall be to your own destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words unto them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a mighty voice, saying: Now is the time to repent, for the day of salvation draweth nigh;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And they are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we know not how soon.  Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it shall be made known unto just and holy men, by the mouth of angels, at the time of his coming, that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled, according to that which they have spoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering;</li>
            <li id="alma_13.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by the chains of hell, that ye may not suffer the second death.</li>
            <li id="alma_13.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not written in this book.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_10.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_10.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was that same Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the hands of his brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power.  I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house.  And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house&#x2014;and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices&#x2014;yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come down among my people, with equity and justice in my hands.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts?  Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, according to their truth?</li>
            <li id="alma_10.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> For behold, have I testified against your law?  Ye do not understand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law.  And now he says that he has not spoken against it.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things against him.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom.  Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_10.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their employ.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_14.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass after he had made an end of speaking unto the people many of them did believe on his words, and began to repent, and to search the scriptures.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the plainness of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had lied unto them, and had reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they had testified so plainly against their wickedness, they sought to put them away privily.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and bound them with strong cords, and took them before the chief judge of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And the people went forth and witnessed against them&#x2014;testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should not save them; and many such things did the people testify against Alma and Amulek.  Now this was done before the chief judge of the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his lying words; and his soul began to be harrowed up under a consciousness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the pains of hell.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that he began to cry unto the people, saying: Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before God.  And he began to plead for them from that time forth; but they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil?  And they spit upon him, and cast him out from among them, and also all those who believed in the words which had been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at them.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire; and they also brought forth their records which contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be burned and destroyed by fire.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene?  Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they will burn us also.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord.  But, behold, our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had been cast into the fire were consumed, and also the records which were cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon their cheeks, and said unto them: After what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone?</li>
            <li id="alma_14.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith.  And the judge smote them again upon their cheeks, and asked: What say ye for yourselves?</li>
            <li id="alma_14.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew Gideon.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him nothing; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast into prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And when they had been cast into prison three days, there came many lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the prison to see them, and they questioned them about many words; but they answered them nothing.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why do ye not answer the words of this people?  Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames?  And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks.  And many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn our law?  If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver yourselves?</li>
            <li id="alma_14.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we look when we are damned?</li>
            <li id="alma_14.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days.  And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound with strong cords, and confined in prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of their teachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison where Alma and Amulek were bound with cords.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again, and said unto them: If ye have the power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people according to your words.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O Lord?  O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance.  And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power, according to their faith which was in Christ.  And they straightway came forth out of the prison; and they were loosed from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and every soul within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_14.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now the people having heard a great noise came running together by multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek coming forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had fallen to the earth, they were struck with great fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even as a goat fleeth with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee from the presence of Alma and Amulek.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 12</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_12.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his lying and deceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble under a consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that which Amulek had done.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the people round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on this wise:</li>
            <li id="alma_12.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this people that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us out&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee.  Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto thee I say unto all.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God.  And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be judged according to their works?</li>
            <li id="alma_12.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction.  Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being brought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our works.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God&#x2019;s justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking these words, the people began to be more astonished;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, came forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an immortal state, that the soul can never die?</li>
            <li id="alma_12.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever?  And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to explain.  Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would have been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none effect.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto them;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first transgressed the first commandments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme goodness of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being the plan of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;</li>
            <li id="alma_12.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will harden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his wrath upon you as in the first provocation, yea, according to his word in the last provocation as well as the first, to the everlasting destruction of your souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the last death, as well as the first.</li>
            <li id="alma_12.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us in these his second commandments which he has given unto us; but let us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared according to his word.</li>

        <div class="navheading">CHAPTER 15</div>
        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_15.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to depart out of that city; and they departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found all the people who had departed out of the land of Ammonihah, who had been cast out and stoned, because they believed in the words of Alma.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And they related unto them all that had happened unto their wives and children, and also concerning themselves, and of their power of deliverance.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which was caused by the great tribulations of his mind on account of his wickedness, for he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no more; and he supposed that they had been slain because of his iniquity.  And this great sin, and his many other sins, did harrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having no deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning heat.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of Sidom, his heart began to take courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the message which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the house unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed, sick, being very low with a burning fever; and his mind also was exceedingly sore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand: Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?</li>
            <li id="alma_15.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the words that thou hast taught.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And Alma said: If thou believest in the redemption of Christ thou canst be healed.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And he said: Yea, I believe according to thy words.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have mercy on this man, and heal him according to his faith which is in Christ.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom leaped upon his feet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great astonishment of all the people; and the knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land of Sidom.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from that time forth to preach unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and consecrated priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the Lord whosoever were desirous to be baptized.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock in from all the region round about Sidom, and were baptized.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of Nehor, and did not believe in the repentance of their sins.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having forsaken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which were in the land of Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being rejected by those who were once his friends and also by his father and his kindred;</li>
            <li id="alma_15.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom, seeing a great check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as to the pride of their hearts, and began to humble themselves before God, and began to assemble themselves together at their sanctuaries to worship God before the altar, watching and praying continually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and from death, and from destruction&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_15.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore he took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_15.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_16.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there having been much peace in the land of Zarahemla, there having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of years, even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the wilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city of Ammonihah, and began to slay the people and destroy the city.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a sufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had destroyed the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, and also some around the borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain those who had been carried away captive into the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi and Aha)&#x2014;now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was high priest over the church, and having heard that he had the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went unto him and desired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go into the wilderness in search of their brethren, who had been taken captive by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning the matter.  And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the Lamanites will cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up beyond the borders of the land of Manti.  And behold there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon, and there the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren who have been taken captive by the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the river Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond the borders of Manti into the south wilderness, which was on the east side of the river Sidon.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren who had been taken captive by the Lamanites, and there was not one soul of them had been lost that were taken captive.  And they were brought by their brethren to possess their own lands.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites having been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites was destroyed, and also their great city, which they said God could not destroy, because of its greatness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> But behold, in one day it was left desolate; and the carcasses were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Nevertheless, after many days their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering.  And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.  And it was called Desolation of Nehors; for they were of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands remained desolate.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.  And thus for three years did the people of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart the word of God, without any respect of persons, continually.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who had been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all the land.  And the establishment of the church became general throughout the land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And there was no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out his Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of the children of men, or to prepare their hearts to receive the word which should be taught among them at the time of his coming&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_16.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> That they might not be hardened against the word, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they might receive the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true vine, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord their God.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now those priests who did go forth among the people did preach against all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering, murdering, committing adultery, and all manner of lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_16.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding forth the coming of the Son of God, his sufferings and death, and also the resurrection of the dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would appear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness.</li>
            <li id="alma_16.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now after the church had been established throughout all the land&#x2014;having got the victory over the devil, and the word of God being preached in its purity in all the land, and the Lord pouring out his blessings upon the people&#x2014;thus ended the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_17.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much success in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and confess their sins before him.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much labor in the spirit.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their father, Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having refused the kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them, and also this was the minds of the people;</li>
            <li id="alma_17.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their arrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might provide food for themselves while in the wilderness.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers which they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach the word of God unto the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and said unto them: Be comforted.  And they were comforted.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their harvest; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering, that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers; notwithstanding the promises of the Lord were extended unto them on the conditions of repentance.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and went forth among them, every man alone, according to the word and power of God which was given unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did administer unto them, and he departed from them, after having blessed them according to their several stations, having imparted the word of God unto them, or administered unto them before his departure; and thus they took their several journeys throughout the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called after the sons of Ishmael, who also became Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and bound him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni.  And it came to pass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as he was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their flocks to the place of water, which was called the water of Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that they may have water&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_17.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and scattered the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these men.  And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered already.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> Now they wept because of the fear of being slain.  Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather them together again to the place of water.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon said unto his brethren: Encircle the flocks round about that they flee not; and I go and contend with these men who do scatter our flocks.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth and stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in number not a few.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of their men could slay him according to their pleasure, for they knew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver his sons out of their hands; neither did they know anything concerning the Lord; therefore they delighted in the destruction of their brethren; and for this cause they stood to scatter the flocks of the king.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain number of them insomuch that they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were angry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they could not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch that they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they were not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it were their leader with his sword; and he smote off as many of their arms as were lifted against him, and they were not a few.</li>
            <li id="alma_17.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they watered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the king, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony of the things which they had done.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_19.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that after two days and two nights they were about to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre, which they had made for the purpose of burying their dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she sent and desired that he should come in unto her.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and went in unto the queen, and desired to know what she would that he should do.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And she said unto him: The servants of my husband have made it known unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that thou hast power to do many mighty works in his name;</li>
            <li id="alma_19.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the space of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not dead, but others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he doth not stink.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was under the power of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God, which was a marvelous light of his goodness&#x2014;yea, this light had infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having been dispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in his soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame, and he was carried away in God&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_19.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Therefore, what the queen desired of him was his only desire. Therefore, he went in to see the king according as the queen had desired him; and he saw the king, and he knew that he was not dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but he sleepeth in God, and on the morrow he shall rise again; therefore bury him not.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And Ammon said unto her: Believest thou this?  And she said unto him: I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of our servants; nevertheless I believe that it shall be according as thou hast said.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such great faith among all the people of the Nephites.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her husband, from that time even until that time on the morrow which Ammon had appointed that he should rise.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words of Ammon; and as he arose, he stretched forth his hand unto the woman, and said: Blessed be the name of God, and blessed art thou.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name.  Now, when he had said these words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered by the Spirit.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out according to his prayers upon the Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the cause of so much mourning among the Nephites, or among all the people of God because of their iniquities and their traditions, he fell upon his knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God for what he had done for his brethren; and he was also overpowered with joy; and thus they all three had sunk to the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had fallen, they also began to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them also, for it was they who had stood before the king and testified unto him concerning the great power of Ammon.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the Lord, in their might, even until they had all fallen to the earth, save it were one of the Lamanitish women, whose name was Abish, she having been converted unto the Lord for many years, on account of a remarkable vision of her father&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_19.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having made it known, therefore, when she saw that all the servants of Lamoni had fallen to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the king, and Ammon lay prostrate upon the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and supposing that this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened among them, that by beholding this scene it would cause them to believe in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the people.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house of the king.  And there came a multitude, and to their astonishment, they beheld the king, and the queen, and their servants prostrate upon the earth, and they all lay there as though they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold, he was a Nephite.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And now the people began to murmur among themselves; some saying that it was a great evil that had come upon them, or upon the king and his house, because he had suffered that the Nephite should remain in the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But others rebuked them, saying: The king hath brought this evil upon his house, because he slew his servants who had had their flocks scattered at the waters of Sebus.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And they were also rebuked by those men who had stood at the waters of Sebus and scattered the flocks which belonged to the king, for they were angry with Ammon because of the number which he had slain of their brethren at the waters of Sebus, while defending the flocks of the king.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now, one of them, whose brother had been slain with the sword of Ammon, being exceedingly angry with Ammon, drew his sword and went forth that he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and as he lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for the Lord had said unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be unto him according to thy faith&#x2014;therefore, Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the man had fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, fear came upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to touch him or any of those who had fallen; and they began to marvel again among themselves what could be the cause of this great power, or what all these things could mean.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And it came to pass that there were many among them who said that Ammon was the Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by the Great Spirit;</li>
            <li id="alma_19.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> But others rebuked them all, saying that he was a monster, who had been sent from the Nephites to torment them.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great Spirit to afflict them because of their iniquities; and that it was the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said that it was this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of their brethren, the Lamanites.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among them.  And while they were thus contending, the woman servant who had caused the multitude to be gathered together came, and when she saw the contention which was among the multitude she was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the hand, that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as soon as she touched her hand she arose and stood upon her feet, and cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell!  O blessed God, have mercy on this people!</li>
            <li id="alma_19.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And when she had said this, she clasped her hands, being filled with joy, speaking many words which were not understood; and when she had done this, she took the king, Lamoni, by the hand, and behold he arose and stood upon his feet.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And he, immediately, seeing the contention among his people, went forth and began to rebuke them, and to teach them the words which he had heard from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as heard his words believed, and were converted unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> But there were many among them who would not hear his words; therefore they went their way.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also administered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and they did all declare unto the people the selfsame thing&#x2014;that their hearts had been changed; that they had no more desire to do evil.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had seen angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told them things of God, and of his righteousness.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And it came to pass that there were many that did believe in their words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they became a righteous people, and they did establish a church among them.</li>
            <li id="alma_19.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his Spirit upon them; and we see that his arm is extended to all people who will repent and believe on his name.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_18.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants should stand forth and testify to all the things which they had seen concerning the matter.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man.  Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they scatter the king&#x2019;s flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king.  And now, O king, we do not believe that a man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at this time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I did your brethren.  Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our fathers have spoken.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from his father, that there was a Great Spirit.  Notwithstanding they believed in a Great Spirit, they supposed that whatsoever they did was right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his servants;</li>
            <li id="alma_18.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> For he had slain many of them because their brethren had scattered their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because they had had their flocks scattered they were slain.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the waters of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby they might drive away many that were scattered unto their own land, it being a practice of plunder among them.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying: Where is this man that has such great power?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there had been a great feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his chariots he was more astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; therefore he was about to return out of his presence.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And one of the king&#x2019;s servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which is, being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their kings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king?  And the king answered him not for the space of an hour, according to their time, for he knew not what he should say unto him.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What desirest thou of me?  But the king answered him not.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the Spirit of God, therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king.  And he said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and slew seven of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvelings?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great?  Behold, I am a man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is right, that will I do.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again, for he beheld that Ammon could discern his thoughts; but notwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou?  Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows all things?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart?  Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my flocks&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_18.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things?  And this is the thing that I desire of thee.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all thy words.  And thus he was caught with guile.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that meaneth.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great Spirit?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And he said, Yea.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And Ammon said: This is God.  And Ammon said unto him again: Believest thou that this Great Spirit, who is God, created all things which are in heaven and in the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which are in the earth; but I do not know the heavens.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God dwells and all his holy angels.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou hast spoken.  Art thou sent from God?</li>
            <li id="alma_18.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was created after the image of God, and I am called by his Holy Spirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be brought to a knowledge of that which is just and true;</li>
            <li id="alma_18.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.36" class=""><span class="verse">36</span> Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the prophets, even down to the time that their father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.37" class=""><span class="verse">37</span> And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the king and to his servants) all the journeyings of their fathers in the wilderness, and all their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their travail, and so forth.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.38" class=""><span class="verse">38</span> And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all their rebellions did he relate unto them; and he expounded unto them all the records and scriptures from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem down to the present time.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.39" class=""><span class="verse">39</span> But this is not all; for he expounded unto them the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world; and he also made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and all the works of the Lord did he make known unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.40" class=""><span class="verse">40</span> And it came to pass that after he had said all these things, and expounded them to the king, that the king believed all his words.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.41" class=""><span class="verse">41</span> And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; according to thy abundant mercy which thou hast had upon the people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.42" class=""><span class="verse">42</span> And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he were dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_18.43" class=""><span class="verse">43</span> And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried him in unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead for the space of two days and two nights; and his wife, and his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after the manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his loss.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_20.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> And it came to pass that when they had established a church in that land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he said unto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I go that I may deliver them.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the Lord thou canst do all things.  But behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and he will cast thy brethren out of prison.  Now Lamoni said unto him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?</li>
            <li id="alma_20.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and he said unto me&#x2014;Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of Middoni.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants should make ready his horses and his chariots.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the land of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he will cast thy brethren out of prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni were journeying thither, they met the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye not come to the feast on that great day when I made a feast unto my sons, and unto my people?</li>
            <li id="alma_20.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, who is one of the children of a liar?</li>
            <li id="alma_20.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he was going, for he feared to offend him.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own kingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he had prepared.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold, to his astonishment, his father was angry with him, and said: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, who are sons of a liar.  Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his children are also come amongst us that they may, by their cunning and their lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our property.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay Ammon with the sword.  And he also commanded him that he should not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him to the land of Ishmael.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will I return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni that I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are just men and holy prophets of the true God.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> Now when his father had heard these words, he was angry with him, and he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt not slay thy son; nevertheless, it were better that he should fall than thee, for behold, he has repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul could not be saved.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if thou shouldst slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood would cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him, saying: I know that if I should slay my son, that I should shed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon.  But Ammon withstood his blows, and also smote his arm that he could not use it.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to plead with Ammon that he would spare his life.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will smite thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be cast out of prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare me I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half of the kingdom.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him, but grant that he may do according to his own desires in whatsoever thing he thinketh, then will I spare thee; otherwise I will smite thee to the earth.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to rejoice because of his life.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to destroy him, and when he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Because this is all that thou hast desired, that I would release thy brethren, and suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant unto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and forever; and I will govern him no more&#x2014;</li>
            <li id="alma_20.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of prison, and thou and thy brethren may come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall greatly desire to see thee.  For the king was greatly astonished at the words which he had spoken, and also at the words which had been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore he was desirous to learn them.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their journey towards the land of Middoni.  And Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon were brought forth out of prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful, for behold they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly because of being bound with strong cords.  And they also had suffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions; nevertheless they were patient in all their sufferings.</li>
            <li id="alma_20.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; therefore they would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out, and had smitten them, and had driven them from house to house, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in the land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into prison, and bound with strong cords, and kept in prison for many days, and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_21.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites, Jerusalem, calling it after the land of their fathers&#x2019; nativity; and it was away joining the borders of Mormon.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of Amulon had built a great city, which was called Jerusalem.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites and the Amulonites were still harder; therefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax strong in wickedness and their abominations.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and first began to preach to the Amalekites.  And he began to preach to them in their synagogues, for they had built synagogues after the order of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to preach unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast testified?  Hast thou seen an angel?  Why do not angels appear unto us?  Behold are not this people as good as thy people?</li>
            <li id="alma_21.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish.  How knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts?  How knowest thou that we have cause to repent?  How knowest thou that we are not a righteous people?  Behold, we have built sanctuaries, and we do assemble ourselves together to worship God.  We do believe that God will save all men.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God shall come to redeem mankind from their sins?</li>
            <li id="alma_21.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And the man said unto him: We do not believe that thou knowest any such thing.  We do not believe in these foolish traditions.  We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and that there could be no redemption for mankind save it were through the death and sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And it came to pass as he began to expound these things unto them they were angry with him, and began to mock him; and they would not hear the words which he spake.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he departed out of their synagogue, and came over to a village which was called Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word unto them; and also Ammah and his brethren.  And they contended with many about the word.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into the land of Middoni.  And they did preach the word unto many, and few believed on the words which they taught.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were taken and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni unto the regions round about.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and they were delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon, and they were fed and clothed.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they were delivered for the first time out of prison; and thus they had suffered.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the Spirit of the Lord, preaching the word of God in every synagogue of the Amalekites, or in every assembly of the Lamanites where they could be admitted.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that the Lord began to bless them, insomuch that they brought many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, they did convince many of their sins, and of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned from the land of Middoni to the land of Ishmael, which was the land of their inheritance.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should serve him, or be his servant.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> But he caused that there should be synagogues built in the land of Ishmael; and he caused that his people, or the people who were under his reign, should assemble themselves together.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many things.  And he did also declare unto them that they were a people who were under him, and that they were a free people, that they were free from the oppressions of the king, his father; for that his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the people who were in the land of Ishmael, and in all the land round about.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> And he also declared unto them that they might have the liberty of worshiping the Lord their God according to their desires, in whatsoever place they were in, if it were in the land which was under the reign of king Lamoni.</li>
            <li id="alma_21.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; and it came to pass that he did teach them all things concerning things pertaining to righteousness.  And he did exhort them daily, with all diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were zealous for keeping the commandments of God.</li>

        <ul class="versesblock">
            <li id="alma_22.1" class=""><span class="verse">1</span> Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was led by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the king which was over all the land save it were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.2" class=""><span class="verse">2</span> And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king&#x2019;s palace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and said unto him: Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast delivered out of prison.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.3" class=""><span class="verse">3</span> And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy servants.  And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant unto you your lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been somewhat troubled in mind because of the generosity and the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with thee.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.4" class=""><span class="verse">4</span> And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has called him another way; he has gone to the land of Ishmael, to teach the people of Lamoni.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.5" class=""><span class="verse">5</span> Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said concerning the Spirit of the Lord?  Behold, this is the thing which doth trouble me.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.6" class=""><span class="verse">6</span> And also, what is this that Ammon said&#x2014;If ye will repent ye shall be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off at the last day?</li>
            <li id="alma_22.7" class=""><span class="verse">7</span> And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?  And the king said: I know that the Amalekites say that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they should build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves together to worship him.  And if now thou sayest there is a God, behold I will believe.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.8" class=""><span class="verse">8</span> And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and he said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a God.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.9" class=""><span class="verse">9</span> And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?</li>
            <li id="alma_22.10" class=""><span class="verse">10</span> And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he created all things both in heaven and in earth.  Believest thou this?</li>
            <li id="alma_22.11" class=""><span class="verse">11</span> And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all things, and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these things, and I will believe thy words.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.12" class=""><span class="verse">12</span> And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the king&#x2014;how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of transgression, man had fallen.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.13" class=""><span class="verse">13</span> And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.14" class=""><span class="verse">14</span> And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.15" class=""><span class="verse">15</span> And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken?  Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day?  Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.16" class=""><span class="verse">16</span> But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.17" class=""><span class="verse">17</span> And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:</li>
            <li id="alma_22.18" class=""><span class="verse">18</span> O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day.  And now when the king had said these words, he was struck as if he were dead.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.19" class=""><span class="verse">19</span> And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen all that had happened unto the king.  And she came in unto the king; and when she saw him lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron and his brethren standing as though they had been the cause of his fall, she was angry with them, and commanded that her servants, or the servants of the king, should take them and slay them.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.20" class=""><span class="verse">20</span> Now the servants had seen the cause of the king&#x2019;s fall, therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is mightier than us all?  Therefore we shall fall before them.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.21" class=""><span class="verse">21</span> Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also began to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon her.  And she commanded her servants that they should go and call the people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.22" class=""><span class="verse">22</span> Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, he, also knowing the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest that a multitude should assemble themselves together, and there should be a great contention and a disturbance among them; therefore he put forth his hand and raised the king from the earth, and said unto him: Stand.  And he stood upon his feet, receiving his strength.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.23" class=""><span class="verse">23</span> Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of the servants.  And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and began to fear.  And the king stood forth, and began to minister unto them.  And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his whole household were converted unto the Lord.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.24" class=""><span class="verse">24</span> Now there was a multitude gathered together because of the commandment of the queen, and there began to be great murmurings among them because of Aaron and his brethren.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.25" class=""><span class="verse">25</span> But the king stood forth among them and administered unto them.  And they were pacified towards Aaron and those who were with him.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.26" class=""><span class="verse">26</span> And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people were pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand forth in the midst of the multitude, and that they should preach the word unto them.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.27" class=""><span class="verse">27</span> And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation throughout all the land, amongst all his people who were in all his land, who were in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east and on the west, and which was divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and round about on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of the wilderness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla, through the borders of Manti, by the head of the river Sidon, running from the east towards the west&#x2014;and thus were the Lamanites and the Nephites divided.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.28" class=""><span class="verse">28</span> Now, the more idle part of the Lamanites lived in the wilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the wilderness on the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the land of Zarahemla, in the borders by the seashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the place of their fathers&#x2019; first inheritance, and thus bordering along by the seashore.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.29" class=""><span class="verse">29</span> And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the seashore, whither the Nephites had driven them.  And thus the Nephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Nephites had taken possession of all the northern parts of the land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the river Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness side; on the north, even until they came to the land which they called Bountiful.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.30" class=""><span class="verse">30</span> And it bordered upon the land which they called Desolation, it being so far northward that it came into the land which had been peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken, which was discovered by the people of Zarahemla, it being the place of their first landing.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.31" class=""><span class="verse">31</span> And they came from there up into the south wilderness.  Thus the land on the northward was called Desolation, and the land on the southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part of which had come from the land northward for food.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.32" class=""><span class="verse">32</span> And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half&#x2019;s journey for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land Desolation, from the east to the west sea; and thus the land of Nephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly surrounded by water, there being a small neck of land between the land northward and the land southward.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.33" class=""><span class="verse">33</span> And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land Bountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the Nephites in their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed in the Lamanites on the south, that thereby they should have no more possession on the north, that they might not overrun the land northward.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.34" class=""><span class="verse">34</span> Therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only in the land of Nephi, and the wilderness round about.  Now this was wisdom in the Nephites&#x2014;as the Lamanites were an enemy to them, they would not suffer their afflictions on every hand, and also that they might have a country whither they might flee, according to their desires.</li>
            <li id="alma_22.35" class=""><span class="verse">35</span> And now I, after having said this, return again to the account of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and their brethren.</li>

<h1 data-aid="154070992" id="title1"><a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng">Alma 13&#x2013;16</a></h1>
</header>
<div class="body-block">
<p data-aid="154070993" id="p1">In many ways, life in Ammonihah had been good for both Amulek and Zeezrom. Amulek was &#x201C;a man of no small reputation,&#x201D; with &#x201C;many kindreds and friends&#x201D; and &#x201C;much riches&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p4#p4">Alma 10:4</a>). Zeezrom was an expert lawyer who enjoyed &#x201C;much business&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p31#p31">Alma 10:31</a>). Then Alma arrived with an invitation to repent and &#x201C;enter into the rest of the Lord&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16">Alma 13:16</a>). For Amulek, Zeezrom, and others, accepting this invitation required sacrifice and even led to almost unbearable adversity.</p>
<p data-aid="154070994" id="p2">But of course the story doesn&#x2019;t end there. In <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng">Alma 13&#x2013;16</a>, we learn what ultimately happens to people who believe &#x201C;in the power of Christ unto salvation&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6">Alma 15:6</a>). Sometimes there&#x2019;s deliverance, sometimes healing&#x2014;and sometimes things don&#x2019;t get any easier in life. But always, &#x201C;the Lord receiveth [His people] up unto himself, in glory&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11">Alma 14:11</a>). Always, the Lord grants &#x201C;power, according to [our] faith &#x2026; in Christ&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p28#p28">Alma 14:28</a>). And always, that faith gives us &#x201C;hope that [we] shall receive eternal life&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p29#p29">Alma 13:29</a>). As you read these chapters, you can take comfort in these promises, and you may come to understand better what Alma meant when he spoke of entering into &#x201C;the rest of the Lord&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16">Alma 13:16</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154070998" id="p3">Alma&#x2019;s words in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng">Alma&#xA0;13</a> reveal powerful truths about God&#x2019;s priesthood power and its purpose&#x2014;to prepare us to enter into &#x201C;the rest of the Lord,&#x201D; or eternal life (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16">Alma 13:16</a>). Perhaps you could write down at least one truth for each verse in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p19#p1">Alma 13:1&#x2013;19</a>. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>

<p data-aid="154071000" id="p5"><span class="dt-inline" id="p4" data-aid="154070999"><a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p1#p1">Verse&#xA0;1</a>.</span>The priesthood is also called &#x201C;the order of [God&#x2019;s] Son&#x201D; (see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p4#p1">Doctrine and Covenants 107:1&#x2013;4</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154071002" id="p7"><span class="dt-inline" id="p6" data-aid="154071001"><a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Verse&#xA0;2</a>.</span>God ordains priests to help people look to His Son for redemption.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p data-aid="154071003" id="p8">What else do you find? How do you feel about the priesthood as you ponder these truths?</p>
<p data-aid="154071004" id="p9">Have you ever thought about priesthood ordinances as a gift from God to help you &#x201C;look forward to his Son for redemption&#x201D;? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">verse&#xA0;2</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16">verse&#xA0;16</a>). Maybe you could make a list of ordinances you&#x2019;ve received, such as baptism, confirmation, the sacrament, setting apart for a calling, a blessing of comfort or healing, a patriarchal blessing, and temple ordinances. Ponder your experiences with ordinances like these. Consider the symbolism involved and the Spirit you felt. How does each of these ordinances point you to Jesus Christ for redemption?</p>
<p data-aid="154071005" id="p10">Some people mistakenly believe that ordinances&#x2014;and the priesthood authority to perform them&#x2014;aren&#x2019;t necessary. How would you respond to this idea? Here are two general conference messages that could inform your thinking; pick one, and write down any answers that come to you: Russell&#xA0;M.

How do we feel when we are dirty? How do we feel when we become clean again? How are these feelings similar to what we feel when we sin and then repent and become clean through the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement?</p>

<p data-aid="154411006" id="p1">Think of all the reasons people might give for not sharing the gospel: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know enough&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure they would be interested&#x201D; or maybe &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ll be rejected.&#x201D; Maybe you&#x2019;ve found yourself thinking similar things at times. The Nephites had an additional reason for not sharing the gospel with the Lamanites: they were described as &#x201C;a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&amp;id=p14#p14">Alma 17:14</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&amp;id=p23-p25#p23">Alma 26:23&#x2013;25</a>). But the sons of Mosiah had an even stronger reason why they felt they <em>must</em> share the gospel with the Lamanites: &#x201C;They were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3">Mosiah 28:3</a>). This love that inspired Ammon and his brothers can also inspire you to share the gospel with your family, friends, and acquaintances&#x2014;even those who may not seem likely to accept it.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154411014" id="p4">The accounts of conversion we read about in the scriptures are often dramatic, but at their core we usually find individuals who had the courage to speak up and share their faith in Jesus Christ. Think about this as you read about Abish and the sons of Mosiah this week.</p>
<p data-aid="154411015" id="p5">What do you think it means to be an instrument in God&#x2019;s hands? It might help to think of instruments or tools that you might use in your daily life. In <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&amp;id=p6-p12#p6">Alma 17:6&#x2013;12</a>, look for what the sons of Mosiah did so they could be instruments in God&#x2019;s hands. How can you become a more effective instrument in helping others come unto Christ?</p>
<p data-aid="154411016" id="p6">What impresses you about Abish in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&amp;id=p16-p36#p16">Alma 19:16&#x2013;36</a>? What do you learn from her about helping others build faith in Christ? For example, what do you feel would help people you love &#x201C;believe in the power of God&#x201D;? (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17">Alma 19:17</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154411017" id="p7">You might also compare Abish&#x2019;s experience with the principles Elder Dieter&#xA0;F. Uchtdorf taught in &#x201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2019/04/14uchtdorf?lang=eng">Missionary Work: Sharing What Is in Your Heart</a>&#x201D; (<cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona</cite>, May 2019, 15&#x2013;18). How did Abish exemplify Elder Uchtdorf&#x2019;s &#x201C;Five Simple Suggestions&#x201D;? Try writing down some things you might say about Jesus Christ. For example, &#x201C;For me, Jesus Christ&#xA0;&#x2026;&#x201D; or &#x201C;The Savior helps me&#xA0;&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p data-aid="154069217" id="p1">God&#x2019;s work will not fail. But our efforts to help with His work sometimes seem to fail&#x2014;at least, we may not immediately see the outcomes we hope for. We might feel a little like Alma when he preached the gospel in Ammonihah&#x2014;rejected, spit on, and cast out. Yet when an angel instructed him to go back and try again, Alma courageously &#x201C;returned speedily&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&amp;id=p18#p18">Alma 8:18</a>), and God prepared the way before him. Not only did He provide Alma with food to eat and a place to stay, but He also prepared Amulek, who became a fellow laborer, a fierce defender of the gospel, and a faithful friend. When we face setbacks and disappointments as we serve in the Lord&#x2019;s kingdom, we can remember how God supported and led Alma, and we can trust that God will support and lead us too, even in difficult circumstances.</p>

<p data-aid="154069239" id="p2">Have you ever tried to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with someone, but your invitation was rejected? Alma experienced that too. What do you learn from him in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&amp;id=p13-p16#p13">Alma 8:13&#x2013;16</a> about sharing the gospel despite challenges and opposition? Continue reading in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&amp;id=p17-p32#p17">verses 17&#x2013;32</a>, and look for phrases that inspire you to keep sharing the gospel, even when you don&#x2019;t seem to be succeeding.</p>
<p data-aid="154069246" id="p3">Prophets and apostles are special witnesses of Christ, so they have a lot of inspired counsel to share about testifying of Him. Look at what Elder Dieter&#xA0;F.

<p data-aid="154069276" id="p6">When reading about the way the Nephites in Ammonihah treated the Lord&#x2019;s servants, it is easy to forget that they once lived the gospel and were a &#x201C;highly favored people of the Lord&#x201D; (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&amp;id=p20#p20">Alma 9:20</a>).

<p data-aid="154069434" id="p26">Perhaps your children could draw a picture representing principles of the plan of redemption, like the Fall of Adam and Eve, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, repentance, death, resurrection, and judgment. Then you could help them match their pictures to verses in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng">Alma 11&#x2013;12</a> that teach about these principles.</p>

<p data-aid="154069439" id="p27">You could invite one child to pretend to be Amulek and another to pretend to be Alma as you tell the story in <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&amp;id=p18-p22#p18">Alma 8:18&#x2013;22</a>. How was Amulek a good friend to Alma? Then your children could share how someone has been a friend to them and how that experience made them feel.</p>

<li>
<p data-aid="154069440" id="p28">Maybe you could make a friendship puzzle: find or draw a picture representing friendship and cut it into puzzle pieces. On the back of each piece, write something we can do to be a good friend, including things Alma and Amulek did. Your children could take turns selecting a piece and adding it to the puzzle as you read what is written on the back. Who needs our friendship?</p>
